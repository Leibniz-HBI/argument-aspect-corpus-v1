__label__OTHER And I just think it 's much to do , minimum wage is much to do about nothing .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS Not true : The typical minimum wage worker is not a high school student earning weekend pocket money .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Proponents of the higher minimum wage say that employees who work full time should be able to live off their pay , and in places that have high costs of living , that ’s becoming increasingly difficult .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE The current minimum wage is not high enough to allow people to afford everyday essentials .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE For starters , I had never considered the diversity of minimum wage earners — this swath of the workforce is made up of teenagers working first jobs , older workers supplementing their income and , yes , people who are truly struggling to make ends meet .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Even if workers are getting a competitive wage , many of us are deeply disturbed that some hard-working families still have very little .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE All around the U.S. , people are sick of making as little as $ 7.25 an hour just to barely scrape by .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS It ’s based on the idea that minimum wage work is just for supplemental income and part-time work .
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES One of the toughest challenges businesses face is encouraging minimum-wage workers to " give their all . "
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES “ Minimum wage should be unlivable , so the people making it are motivated to do something better !
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS Myth 3 : “ The minimum wage is for part-time workers , and people are n’t relying on it to actually support a household . ”
__label__LOW-SKILLED In March , Representative Paul Ryan , attacking the proposed hike at a town-hall meeting , said , “ The majority of these workers are younger people just getting into the workforce . ”
__label__LOW-SKILLED Teenagers and young adults may be shut out of the workforce if the minimum wage is increased .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS “ The typical worker who would be affected by an increase in the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour by 2015 looks nothing like the part-time , teen stereotype : She is in her early thirties , works full-time , and may have a family to support . ”
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE The report stated : " In no state can an individual working a typical 40-hour work week at the federal minimum wage afford a one - or two-bedroom apartment for his or her family . "
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Their present wages are hopelessly inadequate .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS But many minimum wage workers are not working to support a family .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE This is because of the number of minimum wage workers , relatively few are actually in poverty , and of families who live in poverty , only about 7 percent have a full-time worker in the family meaning poverty is not because people are not being paid enough , it is because they are not working or not working enough .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Dr. Amy Glasmeier ’s living wage calculator suggests that a living wage in New York City is $ 14.30 / hour for a single adult taking care of only him/herself .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE In California in 2015 , even a person earning the then state minimum wage of $ 9 per hour would need to work 92 hours a week to afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE In fact , 89 percent of those who would benefit from a federal minimum wage increase to $ 12 per hour are age 20 or older , and 56 percent are women .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS __label__LOW-SKILLED It is a myth that the minimum wage is only for teens and entry level workers .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Similarly , a living wage means something very different for a young adult in the care of family than it does for a family provider .
__label__LOW-SKILLED But let ’s not lock millions of people out of entry-level employment by raising the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE The current minimum wage is not high enough to allow people to afford housing .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES And even if you break your back working in today ’s low-wage economy , it ’s exceedingly difficult to raise yourself up by the bootstraps ; it ’s all but impossible to put yourself through school or save enough money to start a business if you ’re making anything close to $ 7.25 an hour .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS It is true , as conservative commentators often point out , that some minimum-wage workers are middle-class teenagers or secondary earners in fairly well-off households .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS Thus , minimum wage is more often imposed on the sixteen-year-old worker with his first job than on people who would otherwise be unemployed .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE A large percentage of day care staff tend to be paid poverty wages , yet the cost of care is high , especially for infants and often very burdensome for parents . ”
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE " Why ca n't they just figure it out and make ends meet ? "
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS A post by David Henderson cited by the chairman of the Harvard Economics Department , Greg Mankiw , points out that a lot of minimum wage earners are second or third-job holders in households with other income .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS __label__LOW-SKILLED These are entry level jobs and Economist Thomas Sowell points out that the vast majority of people working minimum wage jobs are living in shared family arrangements where people in the same household share expenses .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE According to a 2013 poll by Oxfam America , 66 % of US workers earning less than $ 10 an hour report that they " just meet " or " do n't even have enough to meet " their basic living expenses , and 50 % say that they are frequently worried about affording basic necessities such as food .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Then fuck you , we should pay them what they ’re worth to society — which sure as hell is n’t $ 7.50 / hour .
__label__LOW-SKILLED __label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS __label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE For example , Gramlich ( 1976 ) found that many of the benefits went to higher income families , and that teenagers were made worse off by the unemployment associated with the minimum wage .
__label__LOW-SKILLED That could mean no income or reduced income for low-wage workers .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE The con to that is , if you 're trying to reduce income inequality , this is a pretty blunt instrument to do it .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE It helps some low-income workers , and the costs in terms of employment and inefficiency are likely small .
__label__WELFARE The ability of the earned income tax credit to deliver larger monetary benefits to the poor workers than an increase in the minimum wage and at a lower cost to society was documented in a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE Since firms are allowed to pay poverty-level wages to 3.6 million people -- 5 percent of the workforce -- these workers must rely on Federal income support programs .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Many people feel it is unfair to give a wage increase to someone who does not work hard and who complains at work all the time .
__label__OTHER " It gives low wage employees extra , " Kaplan said .
__label__WELFARE For people that work and depend on the government for some sort of subsidy like food stamps ( the food and nutrition program through the USDA ) they would lose the bulk of the assistance which would NOT make up for the loss of benefits .
__label__WELFARE Others feel that those who tend to live off the system and scream for handouts will be the ones who benefit more from a wage increase since more comes out of your taxes .
__label__WELFARE If minimum wage was increased by a mere 30 % most workers would lose over 91 % in government benefits .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT It means more money for poor Americans , who tend to spend extra more readily than higher earners , as they spend a larger share of their income on basic necessities ( toothpaste costs $ 3 a pop whether you 're rich or poor , after all ) .
__label__WELFARE Lower-wage worker income is being subsidized by the government .
__label__WELFARE 2 - People who get the same amount of government aid as they would for working as justification to increase wages does n’t solve the problem .
__label__LOW-SKILLED __label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE In a 2011 paper they pointed out that a higher minimum wage along with the Earned Income Tax Credit ( which tops up income for poor workers in America ) boosted both employment and earnings for single women with children ( though it cost less-skilled , minority men jobs ) .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE There are better ways to address poverty , such as income tax credits for low-income workers or tax policies that encourage asset development and savings for low-income families .
__label__CAPITAL_VS_LABOR It is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as there would be no risk of destitution for not taking the employment .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Giving workers more money is small potatoes compared with what corporations and the rich are receiving all the time .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE When it was developed as a guideline the theory was that it would offset poverty by requiring business owners and corporate entities to pay a wage that would raise people up out of the poverty level and remove the need for government assistance .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE This would be a very small cost to reduce inequality and poverty , problems that have been plaguing and adversely affecting the economy for decades . ”
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__WELFARE By raising the reward for working , this tax credit also tends to increase the supply of labor .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE They will list a long litany of ways in which the poor and working class have suffered or been left behind in the last few decades , and demand to know why I ’m opposing a measure intended to help the helpless and downtrodden .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT Poverty puts a burden on a national economy , as the government is forced to try and assist those who can not find work .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE The president is certainly correct to turn his attention to the poor , many of whom have been suffering for years in a tough economy .
__label__WELFARE With an increase in pay , low-income workers may no longer have access to helpful public assistance programs , like food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , both of which currently help many low-income workers in pretty significant ways .
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES __label__WELFARE As a result , some of the benefits go to businesses , as would be the case with any wage subsidy .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Interestingly , according to Sabia and Burkhauser , even if you do factor in fairly high job losses , both the poor and middle class would likely come out ahead on total pay , thanks to all the workers who would get raises .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE " The pro argument would be that it 's potentially a policy to stem the increases in income inequality that we 've seen in the U.S. in the past 30 to 40 years , " he said .
__label__PRICES Many business owners offset these costs by passing them off to consumers .
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES Ngoussou says businesses like his need a break on taxes and fees .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT Even assuming that all of that higher income was redistributed from the wealthiest families , the difference in spending behavior between low-income and high-income consumers is likely to translate into only about an additional $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion in consumer purchases .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE Guryan said : " If the goal is to reduce inequality or improve the well-being of people currently living in poverty , there are other policies that the evidence suggests would be much more cost-effective in the long run , like investing in education , improving funding for things like food stamps and expanding the EITC . "
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE More workers being able to pay for their basic expenses is a good thing , as it may lead to less reliance on government - and state-sponsored financial-aid programs .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES Opponents of the increase say time and money would be better spent improving education and job training programs that will give people a better shot at getting out of minimum wage jobs and into better-paying careers .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES The better approach , according to minimum wage hike opponents , is to put money into education and job preparedness plans , which they say have proven success records .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE All levels of government provide widespread corporate welfare so why not provide some help to low wage workers ?
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE To the extent that some poor households also lose jobs , their net losses would be greater . "
__label__OTHER There are better ways to help the poor .
__label__WELFARE A tax credit is less politically palatable because it takes money directly out of federal coffers , while the minimum wage can be raised without it showing up directly on the government ’s books .
__label__OTHER The EITC has even been proven to have profound emotional and psychological benefits on the working poor .
__label__WELFARE Meanwhile , economists like Jess Rothstein of the University of California , Berkeley , argue that by drawing more people into the labor market , the EITC actually pushes down wages .
__label__OTHER These are major benefits , especially when we consider the economy that is still struggling to recover .
__label__WELFARE But with a minimum wage increase , many of the families and people who now use these programs may no longer be eligible for them -- which could ultimately hurt these low-income individuals .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE In 2012 the richest 1 % of the US population earned 22.83 % of the nation 's total pre-tax income resulting in the widest gap between the rich and the poor since the 1920s .
__label__OTHER The case for a higher minimum wage grows even weaker when you stop to consider that there are vastly superior alternatives for steering money to low-income households .
__label__OTHER In fact , it 's still well below the median household income of $ 51,000 .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Some suggest that creating more jobs for people who need them rather than raising earnings for people who already have them is a better solution for reducing the national poverty rate .
__label__WELFARE One alternative is the Earned Income Tax Credit .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE For example , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that expanding the earned income tax credit is a much more efficient way to fight poverty than increasing the minimum wage .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__WELFARE Some economists argue that there is a better alternative in the form of wage subsidies , which cost governments money but do not discourage hiring .
__label__WELFARE People that worked for minimum wage would no longer have to be reliant on federal programs to make ends meet .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES __label__WELFARE I think the EITC and education are two pragmatic tools that are being overshadowed by our focus on the politically attractive minimum wage .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE However , even under these assumptions , just 10.9 % ( $ 439 million ) of these benefits will be received by the working poor ( column 2 ) , and 24.6 % of the benefits will be received by workers living in poor or near-poor households .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Cooper said : " I think a lot of these arguments are straw men arguments , and they 're set up to basically say we should n't enact this policy , that by all reasonable measures would improve the living standards of millions of people , based on the theoretical possibility that it might make things harder for a relatively small number of people . "
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE First , many people who live in poverty do not work , and would thus be unaffected by an increase in the minimum wage .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__PRICES This means that while some workers would be lifted out of poverty , many would lose their jobs , plunging them into greater financial straits , while all consumers would lose out from paying more for goods and services .
__label__WELFARE If low-income workers earned more money , their dependence on , and eligibility for , government benefits would decrease .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__PRICES This makes poor consumers worse off in a direct sense , in that they can purchase less with their earnings .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE " By increasing workers ' take-home pay , families gain both financial security and an increased ability to purchase goods and services , thus creating jobs for other Americans , " concluded left-leaning Washington , D.C.-based think tank the Economic Policy Institute in a brief supporting minimum wage increases .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Because there are much better alternatives to help poor families , and because the minimum wage is a dishonest approach that hides the true cost of the policy .
__label__WELFARE If politicians want to increase the earned income tax credit or other work-related welfare benefits , they should do the hard work of building political support for such policies , rather than choosing the roundabout approach of a minimum wage increase .
__label__WELFARE So some of these public assistance losses can also be seen as things people simply would n't need any longer .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES Poorer people typically spend a larger fraction of their income than more affluent people .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE Work is supposed to make one independent , but with the inflation-adjusted federal minimum down by a third from its peak , low-wage workers depend on billions of dollars in public assistance just to make ends meet .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE And even if there are job some losses , the math seems to suggest that the middle class and poor would still earn more income collectively in the deal .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Though this mutes some of the direct redistributive value of the program — particularly if there ’s no constraining minimum wage — it also tends to increase employment .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage , because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households ( for example , teenagers still living with their parents ) .
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES __label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT Furthermore , the more low wage workers make , the more they will spend , which can help to offset the cost of higher wages for many companies .
__label__WELFARE Reduced Expense for Social Programs : Employees surviving at minimum wage are also often the same people who must rely on additional support of government run social programs to support themselves and their families on such a small amount of income .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE __label__WELFARE In addition to the cost of losing benefits it would also increase tax liability for the people that can least afford the loss .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Not only has it pushed up pay for the bottom 5 % of workers , but it also seems to have boosted earnings further up the income scale — and thus reduced wage inequality .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Among the 34 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) member countries , the United States has one of the highest levels of income inequality , with only Chile , Mexico , and Turkey having higher levels of income inequality .
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES __label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE They argue that these alternatives may address the issue of poverty better than a minimum wage , as it would benefit a broader population of low wage earners , not cause any unemployment , and distribute the costs widely rather than concentrating it on employers of low wage workers .
__label__OTHER New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also come out in favor of a $ 15 minimum wage for his state .
__label__OTHER And no , $ 15/hr is not too much .
__label__OTHER Now it ’s time for me to write the opposite article -- the idea of a $ 15 minimum wage is being taken too far , too fast .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT In essence , a $ 15 minimum wage is a tax on everyone , but the upside is that the worker will have more money to buy things for their family that adds to the economy .
__label__OTHER My view is that the labor market is changing in ways that make huge minimum wage hikes , like the one backed by the Fight for 15 movement , very dangerous .
__label__OTHER We must increase it to $ 15 an hour over the next several years . "
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Yet while there ’s growing consensus that lower-income workers need more support , not everyone agrees that a wage increase to $ 15/hour is the best solution .
__label__OTHER Smaller minimum wage hikes in the past were n’t too damaging , but $ 15 is uncharted territory .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Raising the federal minimum wage to $ 15 an hour is a simple and effective way to fight growing inequality and empower working people to provide a decent life for their families . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE He as well believes that an increase to $ 15 an hour would cause job loss at an extraordinary level .
__label__OTHER If the worker 's pay jumps to $ 15 , yearly earnings would move to $ 31,200 per year for a 40-hour week .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE This means that a $ 15 federal minimum wage would only raise the wages of the urban working class a modest amount , but would raise the wages of the small-town working class a huge amount .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Scarda says that the downside to a $ 15 minimum wage is that some minimum wage earners will lose their jobs or have their hours cut .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Looking at the argument from this perspective , the proposed increased wage to $ 15 will provide a living wage .
__label__OTHER So although I ’m glad to see cities experimenting with a $ 15 minimum wage , I think we should avoid implementing the policy at the federal level , at least until we see the results of the local experiments .
__label__OTHER In other words , while jumping straight to $ 15/hour might be too drastic a change , with planning and patience , even by more conservative estimates it seems doable .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE But $ 15 , it 's gon na destroy jobs . "
__label__LOW-SKILLED But even if we completely ignore the possibility that firms will learn to economize on less-skilled labor , $ 15 an hour is a bridge too far .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE It seemed like an uncontroversial claim ; even supporters of the Fight for $ 15 said they would be willing to pay a bit more to give workers a living wage .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE The groundswell of support from unions , as well as Democratic politicians , has made a $ 15 minimum wage a popular option for addressing what Orrenius described as the bigger underlying problem : growing income inequality .
__label__PRICES Sara Lemos reviewed the literature and found that most studies reviewed above found that a 10 percent US minimum wage increase raises food prices by no more than 4 percent and overall prices by no more than 0.4 percent . "
__label__LOW-SKILLED Another 2011 study by Sen , Rybczynski , and Van De Waal found that " a 10 % increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3 − 5 % drop in teen employment . "
__label__TURNOVER __label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES Alan Manning , DPhil , Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics , stated in 2014 : " As the minimum wage rises and work becomes more attractive , labor turnover rates and absenteeism tend to decline . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE But a widely cited 2006 study by David Neumark , an economics professor at the University of California at Irvine , and William Wascher , deputy director of research and statistics at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , examined the literature on this issue and found " the weight of the evidence points to disemployment effects . "
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES According to a 2003 study by economists David Neumark , PhD , and William Wascher , PhD , in states where teens can leave school before 18 , a 10 % increase in the minimum wage caused teenage school enrollment to drop by 2 % .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Dube and his collaborators have concluded that modest minimum wage hikes do n’t appear to reduce employment levels .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES Mark J. Perry , PhD , of the American Enterprise Institute states that " the attraction to higher wages from minimum wage legislation reduces high school completion rates for some students with limited skills , who are then disadvantaged with lower wages and career opportunities over the long-run if they never finish high school . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE They found no adverse effects on employment from a higher minimum wage .
__label__LOW-SKILLED Harvard 's Greg Mankiw writes about evidence that suggests raising the minimum wage has a particularly negative impact on employment opportunities for teens , quoting his economics textbook : “ The typical study finds that a 10 % increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employment between 1 and 3 % .
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES __label__PRICES Relatively few employers will have to spend substantially more on their workforce under a higher federal minimum wage , and relatively few will have to raise their prices to account for it .
__label__LOW-SKILLED In interpreting this estimate , note that a 10 % increase in the minimum wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers by 10 % . ”
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE On the other hand , an assessment of data collected and analyzed by Neumark and Wascher did not initially contradict the Card and Krueger results , but in a later edited version they found a four percent decrease in employment , and reported that " the estimated disemployment effects in the payroll data are often statistically significant at the 5 - or 10-percent level although there are some estimators and subsamples that yield insignificant — although almost always negative " employment effects .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES John W. O'Neill , PhD , Director of the School of Hospitality Management at Pennsylvania State University , stated that an increase in the minimum wage to $ 10.10 or higher would " decrease opportunities for upward mobility in the hospitality industry [ where ] entry-level , hourly roles are traditional ' routes to the top ' , " and where workers learn the skills needed to gain a promotion .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE The authors found " little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE The Centre for Economic Performance found no discernible impact on employment levels from the wage increases , while the Low Pay Commission found that employers had reduced their rate of hiring and employee hours employed , and found ways to cause current workers to be more productive ( especially service companies ) .
__label__YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS __label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES Increasing the minimum wage would allow teens to work fewer hours for the same amount of pay giving them more time to study and reducing the likelihood that they would drop out of high school .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages , others see a small one , but none finds any serious damage .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES A 2014 study by Alex Smith , PhD , Assistant Professor of Economics at the United States Military Academy at West Point , found that " an increase in the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 ( 39 % ) ... would lead to a 2-4 percentage point decrease in the likelihood that a low-SES [ socio-economic status ] teen will drop out . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE When Card and Krueger analyzed the results of this “ natural experiment , ” they found no evidence that raising worker pay had killed jobs .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE However , using a different methodology , Stanley concluded that there is evidence of publication bias and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment .
__label__LOW-SKILLED __label__TURNOVER A 2014 University of California at Berkeley study found " striking evidence that ... turnover rates for teens and restaurant workers fall substantially following a minimum wage increase , " declining by about 2 % for a 10 % increase in the minimum wage .
__label__LOW-SKILLED The high-risk scenario is that Neumark and Wascher are right , and a minimum-wage hike to $ 10.10 an hour cuts teen employment by up to 12 percent ( for econ nerds : that 's assuming an elasticity of -0.1 to -0.3 , with an increase of 40 percent ) .
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES Reich and Cooper both said research has shown such increases have small overall effects on employers ' operating costs .
__label__LOW-SKILLED __label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE According to a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study , “ 10 percent increase in the minimum wage lowers low skill employment by 2 to 4 percent and total restaurant employment by 1 to 3 percent . ”
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE They disputed Messrs Card and Krueger ’s findings for New Jersey and argued that a comparison of different states over time showed that higher minimum wages hurt jobs .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE There ’s been a tremendous amount of research on this topic , and the bulk of the empirical analysis finds that the overall adverse employment effects are small .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Again , the wage increase resulted in no negative change in employment levels .
__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES A 2005 study published by Cornell University found that " a longterm 10 % increase in the earnings of low-skilled workers could decrease high school enrollment rates by as much as 5-7 % . "
__label__OTHER Indeed , so far , every time critics point to disaster arising from Seattle ’s minimum wage , they have been wrong .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT And given how low the federal minimum wage is in terms of its purchasing power , it would stand to reason that there ’s a lot of room to increase it before any adverse effects to the economy set in .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Their work was published in 2010 in the journal Review of Economics and Statistics and found that , in the restaurant and retail industries , boosting the minimum wage by 10 percent had effectively no impact on employment levels .
__label__OTHER Yet today the consensus is that Britain ’s minimum wage has done little or no harm .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Job losses from raising the minimum wage are negligible .
__label__LOW-SKILLED James Dorn , PhD , Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute , stated that a 10 % increase in the minimum wage " leads to a 1 to 3 percent decrease in employment of low-skilled workers " in the short term , and " to a larger decrease in the long run . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE In addition , a majority considered disemployment to be a moderate potential drawback to the increase they supported .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__TURNOVER __label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES Some evidence suggests that employment does n’t fall much because the higher minimum wage lowers labor turnover , which raises productivity and labor demand .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Not true : Minimum wage increases have little to no negative effect on employment as shown in independent studies from economists across the country .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Moreover , they concluded , " Once this publication selection is corrected , little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT On the other side , you have researchers who believe that increasing the minimum wage does n't kill jobs at all and may even give the economy a boost by channeling more pay to low-income workers who are likely to spend it .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE An increase to get closer to an inflation-adjusted minimum wage , Orrenius said , probably would n’t negatively affect job numbers .

__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT Management and longtime employees of businesses who have worked their way up through pay raises would also likely have their pay increased to match their title and tenure .
__label__TURNOVER For example , higher wages tend to reduce turnover , so employers will save on hiring and training new employees .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Increases put more money into the pockets of low-income workers .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT Consumer spending uptick : Lastly , extra pay in the pockets of some 16.5 million workers could trickle down to retailers and provide a boost to the economy .

__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES ( Others argue that healthy corporate profits show that firms have plenty of room to accommodate pay rises . )
__label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES It allows businesses to plan ahead for their labor costs , since they know in advance that wages will increase each year .
__label__TURNOVER __label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES This is due to a variety of factors , but the biggest one is that increased wage costs are offset by the dramatically decreased cost and corresponding boost to efficiency that comes with reducing turnover .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT As a matter of record that con is largely unfounded because studies have shown that the higher wages actually helps to increase spending in the economy and increases overall growth of the economy .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT Naturally , the more money workers earn through wages , the more they have to spend as consumers .
__label__GOVERNMENT It is therefore better to let the market take its course and allow businesses to gradually raise their wages of their own accord .
__label__TURNOVER This means there would be a lower turnover rate , which results in fewer expenses to hire and train new employees .
__label__CAPITAL_VS_LABOR Although companies are experiencing greater productivity , since the ‘ 70s , less of the share of wealth created from that productivity has been going towards workers ( Check out this EPI article for more details ) .

__label__MOTIVATION/CHANCES Higher worker morale : Secondly , getting paid more could potentially boost worker morale .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT This increased demand for goods and services tends to stimulate the economy which , in turn , leads to job creation .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE This is because a greater number of people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller number of jobs will be available at the higher wage .
__label__ECONOMIC_IMPACT When poorer workers have more to spend it stimulates effective aggregate demand for goods and services .

__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE " It does n’t reduce incentive for employer to hire , and it helps employees earn more . "
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE We will start by assuming that the supply and demand curves for labor will not change as a result of raising the minimum wage .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE Economist Michael Reich , director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California at Berkeley , said the two goals of a minimum wage increase are to help people pay their bills and to create a more fair working environment .
__label__GOVERNMENT The free market should determine minimum wages , not the federal government .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE The core of the argument here is that the minimum wage is meant to be commensurate with the work skills , education and productivity — at that point in time — of people entering the workforce .
__label__SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE " If we believe we should have a fair society , that in some sense the benefits of economic growth and technological progress should improve not just the living standards of business owners but of workers as well , then the minimum wage really should have grown more over time , " said David Cooper , an economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Under the monopsonistic assumption , an appropriately set minimum wage could increase both wages and employment , with the optimal level being equal to the marginal product of labor .
__label__OTHER If no minimum wage is in place , workers and employers will continue to adjust the quantity of labor supplied according to price until the quantity of labor demanded is equal to the quantity of labor supplied , reaching equilibrium price , where the supply and demand curves intersect .
__label__LOW-SKILLED __label__COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES __label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE __label__PRICES Perry said market-determined wages result in more employment opportunities for unskilled workers , increased profits for companies , and lower prices for the consumer .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Labor supply and the effects of rising unemployment are also considered when establishing minimum wage .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Translated out of econo-speak , that means that the price for labor is set artificially high , with more people willing to work than business will be able to hire .
__label__LOW-SKILLED __label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Thus , according to this explanation , in the absence of the minimum wage law unskilled workers would be paid approximately the same amount and an increase above this equilibrium point could likely bring about increased unemployment for the low and unskilled workers .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE According to basic economics , a price floor creates a surplus , meaning that the labor supply is greater than the demand .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Standard theory says that , if set above the equilibrium price , more labor will be willing to be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers , creating a surplus of labor , i.e. unemployment .
__label__UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE Since higher wages increase the quantity supplied , the supply of labor curve is upward sloping , and is shown as a line moving up and to the right .
__label__GOVERNMENT According to Mark J. Perry , PhD , of the American Enterprise Institute , government-mandated minimum wages " are always arbitrary and almost never based on any sound economic/cost-benefit analysis ... [ I ] n contrast market-determined wages reflect supply and demand conditions that are specific to local market conditions and vary widely by geographic region and by industry . "
