__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS His figures show that nuclear energy is the only source that can challenge the climate-changing and environment-destroying fossil fuels for supremacy in providing the world ’s energy needs .
__label__COSTS So the reactor may be cheap , but we just do n’t know how much the reprocessing will cost .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS And although the reactor itself was crippled , there was no injury or death among nuclear workers or nearby residents .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY If the USA would go nuclear it would have to build thousands of nuclear power plants , how can you call that centralized ?
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT These abandoned reactors are taking up valuable land space , could be contaminating the areas surrounding them , yet are often too unstable to be removed .
__label__RELIABILITY Nuclear energy distracts governments from taking the real global action necessary to tackle climate change and meet people ’s energy needs . "
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Maria Korsnick , the new head of the Nuclear Energy Institute , told skeptical Wall Street analysts in New York today that supporting financially struggling , aging reactors is critical to curbing heat-trapping emissions , and that states like Illinois , New York and now Connecticut are stepping up with financial support ( Energywire , Feb. 9 ) .
