__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS In fact , a scientific consensus exists that marijuana has serious health implications — even for casual users .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS There is lots of health and good benefits to marijuana with only a small amount of negative effects .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA As detailed in the related links section , there are a number of medical benefits of marijuana , most notably in the treatment of patients undergoing chemotherapy .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA As previously mentioned , marijuana brings about a number of medical benefits .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA There ’s no question that marijuana does have medicinal benefits .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Nearly two decades of research have shown that marijuana can be beneficial in alleviating pain and other symptoms associated with an array of illnesses , including cancer and multiple sclerosis .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Proponents of medical marijuana argue that it can be a safe and effective treatment for the symptoms of cancer , AIDS , multiple sclerosis , pain , glaucoma , epilepsy , and other conditions .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA People inside and outside the medical field argue that marijuana is effective in treating a range of health conditions , including Crohn ’s disease , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA One could add glaucoma , Crohn ’s disease and muscle spasms related to multiple sclerosis , and a host of other conditions to those marijuana has effectively treated .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Potentially because of its impact on the brain , marijuana use doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders like schizophrenia for those already prone to them .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Consumption of marijuana impairs the immune system and short-term memory , elevates the risk of heart attack , and causes respiratory and brain damage .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS These studies have also found that marijuana consumption impairs short-term memory , making it difficult to learn and retain information or perform complex tasks ; slows reaction time and impairs motor coordination ; increases heart rate by 20 percent to 100 percent , thus elevating the risk of heart attack ; and alters moods , resulting in artificial euphoria , calmness , or ( in high doses ) anxiety or paranoia .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Marijuana use is associated with cognitive difficulties and influences attention , concentration , and short-term memory .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Marijuana use is associated with memory loss , cancer , immune system deficiencies , heart disease , and birth defects , among other conditions .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Research has discovered a link between marijuana use and mental illnesses , such as schizophrenia and depression .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Research has also found links between marijuana use and several mental health issues such as anxiety , depression , short-term psychosis , suicidal thoughts and schizophrenia .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS However , it is clear that marijuana use plays some role in the mental health picture .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Though researchers are not sure yet if the drug really triggered such conditions or if smokers turned to the drug to mediate the symptoms on their own , but it is clear that smoking weed plays a role in the picture of mental health .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Research has shown that marijuana consumption may also cause “ psychotic symptoms . ”
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__DRUG_ABUSE A recent Northwestern University study found that marijuana users have abnormal brain structure and poor memory and that chronic marijuana abuse may lead to brain changes resembling schizophrenia .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Here ’s the kicker : Studies show even casual marijuana use causes abnormalities in the density , volume and shape of the brain .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Marijuana use can permanently impair brain development .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Developing brains and bodies can be dealt serious blows by the use of marijuana .

__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA On the other hand , some supporters think changing the perception of marijuana from a party drug to a medication might make it less attractive to teens wanting to defy or rebel .

__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Also , there 's always the possibility that the lapse in judgment caused by drug use will lead to harder crimes like rape or robbery .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS The use of drugs changes behavior and causes criminal activity because people will do things they would n't do if they were rational and free of the drug 's influence .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Psychoactive drugs can have a powerful impact on behavior which may influence some people to commit crimes that have nothing to do with supporting the cost of their drug use .

__label__ADDICTION __label__GATEWAY_DRUG Citizens also should not overlook what may be the greatest harms of marijuana legalization : increased addiction to and use of harder drugs .
__label__HARM It is impossible to predict the precise consequences of legalization , but the experiences of places that have eased restrictions on marijuana are not positive .

__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY The normalization , expanded use , and increased availability of marijuana in our communities are detrimental to our youth , to public health , and to the safety of our society .

__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The increased use will increase the multitude of costs that come with marijuana use .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS As cheap marijuana floods the market both in and outside of California , use of many different types of drugs will increase , as will marijuana use .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Thus , marijuana legalization will increase crime , drug use , and social dislocation across the state of California — the exact opposite of what pro-legalization advocates promise .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__DRUG_ABUSE The Rand Corp. said it believes that marijuana use could double in California if legalization passes due to dramatically reduced prices and increased social acceptance – which , in turn , might increase various health risks , including increased heart rate , anxiety as well as incidents of drug-impaired driving .
__label__HARM California ’s voters , if they take a fair-minded look at the evidence and the practical problems of legalization , should reach the same conclusion : Marijuana is a dangerous substance that should remain illegal under state law .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Furthermore , should California legalize marijuana , other entrepreneurs will inevitably attempt to enter the marketplace and game the system .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS The California Chamber of Commerce has also expressed its opposition to the legalization of marijuana , citing that drug users will not be able to perform at work and that passage could create a new class of protected California citizens .
__label__OTHER One of the perhaps unexpected opponents of the initiative are some marijuana growers themselves who worry that legalization will hurt the quality of marijuana available to the public and hurt the nascent marijuana industry that already exists in California .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS R. Gil Kerlikowske , ONDCP Director , Remarks to the California Police Chiefs Conference : Why Marijuana Legalization Would Compromise Public Health and Public Safety ( March 4 , 2010 ) , available at http://www.ondcp.gov/news/speech10/030410_Chief.pdf .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Gil Kerlikowske , Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) , recently stated , “ Marijuana legalization , for any purpose , is a non-starter in the Obama Administration . ”
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Gil Kerlikowske , current director of the US ONDCP , argues that legalizing drugs , then regulating and taxing their sale , would not be effective fiscally .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET In a study for the Cato Institute , Jeffrey A. Miron , senior lecturer on economics at Harvard University and a senior fellow at Cato , and Katherine Waldock , professor of economics at New York University , estimate that legalizing drugs would save the government approximately $ 41.3 billion annually on expenditures related to the enforcement of prohibition .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Miron and Waldock also estimate that in 2008 , states across the country spent a total of $ 25.7-billion on drug prohibition ( net of seizures and fines ) .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET For instance , in 1999 , close to 60,000 prisoners ( 3.3 % of the total incarcerated population ) convicted of violating marijuana laws were behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of some $ 1.2 billion per year .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET There is certainly a financial and human cost to keeping marijuana illegal and we can see it in our prisons .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The social costs of the marijuana laws are vast .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Despite claims to the contrary , the social costs of legalizing marijuana will dwarf the meager taxes raised .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Also , that marijuana legalization would yield tax revenue of $ 2.4 billion annually if it were taxed like all other goods and $ 6.2 billion annually if it were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Within the first 10 months , the sales of marijuana have resulted in nearly $ 40 million in tax revenue .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET According to press reports , supporters of the California initiative estimate that about $ 15-billion worth of marijuana is sold every year in the state – thus , an excise tax on the retail sales of marijuana would likely raise at least $ 1.3 billion a year in revenue .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Indeed , the potential financial gains to be realized through the legalization of drugs would be of particular interest to the state of California , which not only teems with thousands of ( illegal ) marijuana growers , but whose state government also faces a budget shortfall of nearly $ 20-billion for fiscal 2011 .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Approximately $ 8.7 billion of this revenue would result from the legalization of marijuana , $ 32.6 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin , and $ 5.5 billion from legalization of all other drugs .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Miron and Waldock estimate that of that $ 41.3 billion in savings , about $ 8.7 billion would result from the legalization of marijuana alone and $ 32.6 billion from the legalization of other drugs , like cocaine and heroin .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET One study estimates that nationwide marijuana legalization would save governments $ 8.7 billion each year .
__label__OTHER Moreover , according to RAND , legalization will cause marijuana prices to fall as much as 80 percent .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Some believe that marijuana legalization could be a windfall in the form of new taxes applied to its distribution and sale .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Legalization will mean that marijuana businesses can promote their products and package them in attractive ways to increase their market share .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Legalization is the first step in a broader initiative of treating cannabis use as a public health issue .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Legalization solves all these issues and puts organized crime out of the cannabis business .
__label__DRUG_POLICY On the other hand , current legalization efforts create a framework for a safety control system , which will work to get rid of the risk coming from smoking marijuana .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Where your position stands is up to you but , to me ; legalizing marijuana is going to be beneficial to lots of people including the government , homeless , sick , and elderly people .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA The most frequently cited reasons for supporting the legalization of marijuana are its medicinal benefits ( 41 % ) and the belief that marijuana is no worse than other drugs ( 36 % ) – with many explicitly mentioning that they think it is no more dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes .
__label__DRUG_POLICY There is reason even for people who oppose the use of marijuana to support its legalization : legal substances can be controlled in ways illegal ones can not .
__label__HARM Although those who oppose the legalization of marijuana have every reason to believe that further , legitimate scientific research will confirm the dangers of its use , no side should try to thwart the sober judgment of the national legislature and sister states .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Theoretical arguments in favor of marijuana legalization usually overlook the practical matter of how the drug would be regulated and sold .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS A common argument for legalization is that smoking marijuana is no more dangerous than drinking alcohol and that prohibiting the use of marijuana is therefore no more justified than the prohibition of alcohol .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Most people talk about legalizing pot as if it were no worse than alcohol -- as if no one has ever died as the result of using marijuana .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS I get concerns that the impact of legalized pot will be heaviest on poorer neighborhoods , and the fear of edibles , and of increasing drug use in general .
__label__ADDICTION __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Opponents of legal recreational pot argue that any savings that would arise from legalization would be offset by the cost of treating the additional users who become addicted to marijuana .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Not only might the broader legalization of marijuana help more people with unmanageable pain find relief , it could even have a positive , mitigating effect against the opioid epidemic .
__label__OTHER Yes , some who wish to see marijuana legalized use it for recreational purposes , but the other benefits can not be ignored .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY There is no doubt that if marijuana were legalized , more people , including juveniles , would consume it .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY So , any time marijuana use is made legal , the drugs accessibility to children will increase .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Society may not do much better at enforcing this restriction on sale and marketing of marijuana to kids than we have with alcohol and tobacco .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY While all too often children and teenagers are getting their hands on cigarettes and alcohol , it is stressed that authorities should think twice about legalizing this drug .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY When you run around telling kids not to do drugs , young kids , and then they read that we might legalize marijuana , I just think it 's a mixed message .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY It should be intuitively obvious to everyone that if you legalize marijuana for adults , more children will use marijuana because the message that it 's dangerous will be blunted . "
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Opponents worry that legalizing medical marijuana might lead teens to believe that marijuana is safe for recreational use and increase availability of the drug .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY About one-in-five opponents of legalization ( 19 % ) say marijuana is illegal and needs to be policed , 11 % say it is a gateway to harder drugs and 8 % say it is especially harmful to young people .
__label__ADDICTION __label__DRUG_ABUSE __label__HARM And while many supporters of legalization say that marijuana is less dangerous than other drugs , 30 % of opponents have the opposite view : They point to the dangers of marijuana , including the possibility of abuse and addiction .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY __label__GATEWAY_DRUG Indeed , many anti-legalization advocates say that use of marijuana often leads young people to experiment with harder drugs .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY summed up this mind-set during a speech at the Heritage Foundation last year when he said that " relaxing [ marijuana ] laws clearly leads to more teenage drug use .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Marijuana use alone was associated with increased prescription abuse in the teenage girls examined through the study .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY A group of teenage boys who abused weed , along with alcohol and cigarettes , were found to be 2-3 times more likely to abuse prescription drugs when they become young adults .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY A recent Yale University School of Medicine study revealed that teenage boys who abused alcohol , cigarettes , and marijuana were 2 to 3 times more likely to abuse prescription drugs during young adulthood .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Research shows that use of any of these drugs in adolescence — especially early adolescence — significantly heightens risks of substance use disorders in later life .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY “ Early substance use actually effects brain development and predisposes people for more significant vulnerabilities later in their life . ”
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Such use can also affect the brains of people already exhibiting substance abuse issues or mental illness .
__label__HARM [ ... ] The short-term effects are also harmful .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA ( – ) Patients report fewer of the positive effects and more negative side effects .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Increased drug use leads to negative health effects .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Increased Chances of the Drug Falling into the Hands of Children .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY But it has also had the unwanted side effect that Dutch children are frequently exposed to the drug in public areas .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Furthermore , the Dutch Ministry of Health , Welfare and Sport has expressed “ concern about drug and alcohol use among young people and the social consequences , which range from poor school performance and truancy to serious impairment , including brain damage . ”
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Even if critical workers — for example , police officers , airline pilots , and machine operators — used marijuana recreationally but remained sober on the job , the long-term cognitive deficiency that remained from regular drug use would sap productivity and place countless people in danger .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Unlike alcohol , marijuana has been shown to have a residual effect on cognitive ability that persists beyond the period of intoxication .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS The effect on short-term memory is quite noticeable , but marijuana affects long-term memory as well .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Another study finds that the hippocampus — the part of the brain responsible for long-term memory — is abnormally shaped in daily marijuana users .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS MRI scans conducted by researchers in Melbourne , Australia found that prolonged , heavy use of marijuana caused permanent , physical damage to the brain .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Medical researchers in Sweden , Holland ( see this study and this one ) and New Zealand ( see this research and this paper ) found that people who used marijuana for a long time were more likely to suffer medical psychosis or schizophrenia .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS A recent survey of all the medical literature concluded that regular use of cannabis actually doubled your risk of psychosis .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS A 2013 review concluded : “ It is now known beyond doubt that cannabis acts as a component cause of psychosis . ”
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS In fact , high-dose THC – one of the most widely studied molecules in the marijuana plant – has been found to cause acute/transient psychosis .
__label__HARM The levels of THC ( marijuana 's psychoactive ingredient ) have never been higher .
__label__HARM The average THC level in today ’s marijuana is approximately three times that of 1990 , with some experts saying it ’s up to six times more potent .
__label__HARM “ What we know is the THC , the psychoactive component of marijuana , back in the 60 ’s and 70 ’s was less than 1 % .
__label__OTHER The smoke of marijuana contains 60 chemicals known as cannabinoids , and the most popular one is THC .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HARM " Marijuana contains more than 400 chemicals , including the most harmful substances found in tobacco smoke .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__LEGAL_DRUGS Researchers in Canada found that marijuana smoke contains significantly higher levels of numerous toxic compounds , like ammonia and hydrogen cyanide , than regular tobacco smoke .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS While tobacco and cigarettes have a nasty reputation for pumping carcinogens into the lungs , marijuana is estimated to have levels of carcinogens that are almost double of that from tobacco smoke .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS The editorial further explains that cannabis has never been directly linked to any serious disease , the way tobacco has with cancer or alcohol with cirrhosis .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__LEGAL_DRUGS To be fair , however , smoking marijuana does n’t appear to have the same long-term medical consequences of using tobacco : an increased risk of cancer , obesity and heart disease .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM The dangers of second-hand smoke from cigarettes are well publicized , so common sense would just tell us that more widespread use of marijuana will increase the likelihood that other people would suffer the same damage of inhaling smoke , and this time from a heavy drug .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Common sense tells us that more widespread usage of marijuana increases the likelihood that other people would suffer the damage of inhaling other people 's smoke .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG One of the biggest and most widespread arguments from marijuana detractors is that smoking marijuana will lead to using other drugs .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG The US Institute of Medicine found no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs .
__label__HARM As you 'll see by reading research studies from the related links section at the bottom of the page , the studies of the harmfulness of marijuana are inconclusive and contradictory .
__label__HARM The research does not show that marijuana is harmless or OK .

__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__DRUG_ABUSE Many of the deaths from using cannabis , other than from car accidents while intoxicated or violence and aggression , are more likely to figure in the longer term , just as with tobacco , where both nicotine overdose and cannabis overdose are extremely rare .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE In Australia , a study found that cannabis intoxication was responsible for 4.3 % of driver fatalities .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Medical researchers at Columbia University found that drivers who had used marijuana were more than twice as likely to have a car crash .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE A study by AAA of fatal crashes in Washington did indeed find that the share of drivers involved in fatal crashes who had recently used marijuana more than doubled , from 8 percent in 2013 to 17 percent in 2014 .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE In Colorado , recent figures correlate with the years since marijuana legalization to show a dramatic decrease in overall highway fatalities – and a two-fold increase in the frequency of marijuana-positive drivers in fatal auto crashes .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Opponents say crashes caused by marijuana are up in pot-friendly states .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Fatalities doubled in marijuana-related car crashes after legalization in Washington state .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE We will see an inevitable increase in drugged driving deaths - marijuana-involved deaths doubled in Washington state - and there is no Breathalyzer equivalent to detect or punish those who drive impaired on our roads .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Legalization will pose a challenge for law enforcement in determining truly impaired driving from marijuana .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Marijuana legalization means more drugged driving .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY The legalization of marijuana would remove another temptation that could lead a young impressionable individual down the wrong road .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Legalization of marijuana would further shift the culture to more of a " anything goes " mentality .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Legalization of marijuana could eventually lead to the legalization of harder drugs or all drugs altogether .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA But if medical marijuana were legalized , there could be repercussions outside the realm of medicine .
__label__DRUG_POLICY In short , no state will likely be allowed to legalize marijuana on its own , with such serious , negative cross-state spillover effects .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA In more than a dozen states , including California , Massachusetts , and New Jersey , medical marijuana use is already legal under certain guidelines .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA The four other states that have legalized marijuana so far — Alaska , Colorado , Oregon and Washington state — had already established programs to permit people to get marijuana to treat various illnesses .
__label__OTHER Legalized marijuana or weed for recreational use is already existent in several states in the US , including Colorado and Washington , where voters passed ballot initiatives to realize it .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS State officials are greatly relieved that legalization has not thus far brought about an upward spiral of marijuana use in Colorado .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY It is true that a Colorado study found a post-legalization increase in youths being treated for marijuana exposure .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY " We have not seen any statistical increase in marijuana use in Colorado since retail passage , we have not seen an increase in youth use since passage , we have not seen an increase in criminal activity since its passage , " he said .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The same survey found that the number of people who said they consumed marijuana in the past month — people who account for about three-quarters of overall users in Colorado — has increased .
__label__ADDICTION One study found that more than 30 percent of adults who used marijuana in the course of a year were dependent on the drug .
__label__ADDICTION He reports that marijuana leads to dependence in around 9-10 percent of adult users .
__label__ADDICTION About 9 % of marijuana users end up becoming addicted to the drug .
__label__ADDICTION The National Institutes of Health finds 30 percent of users form some sort of dependence on the drug , with about 10 percent of those users becoming addicted .
__label__ADDICTION __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS So as the amount of users increases , as it is here , that ratio of addicts is going to get larger .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Based on the experience elsewhere , the number of users will double or triple .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS This means an additional 17 to 34 million young and adult users in the United States .
__label__ADDICTION __label__DRUG_ABUSE __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY 2.1 million children in the United States live with at least one parent who was dependent on or abused illicit drugs .
__label__ADDICTION __label__DRUG_ABUSE __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Up-to-date estimates of the number of children living with substance-dependent or substance-abusing parents are needed for planning both adult treatment and prevention efforts and programs that support and protect affected children .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__DRUG_ABUSE __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Affected by an individual 's illicit drug use are children , parents , grandparents , friends , colleagues , work , victims of drugged drivers , crime victims , elder abuse , sexual victims etc .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Illicit drug use is no less victimless than alcoholism .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__ADDICTION " [ ... ] " As is the case with alcohol addiction , illicit drug addictions likewise serve to keep many such users functionally in poverty and often as a continued burden on friends , family and society .
__label__ADDICTION Finally , and not the least of the evils associated with repression , the helpless addict has been forced to resort to crime in order to get money for the drug which is absolutely indispensable for his comfortable existence .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Repression has driven this vice underground and produced the narcotic smugglers and supply agents , who have grown wealthy out of this evil practice and who , by devious methods , have stimulated traffic in drugs .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE It does so by permitting and indeed , causing the drug trade to remain a lucrative source of economic opportunity for street dealers , drug kingpins and all those willing to engage in the often violent , illicit , black market trade .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE “ You ’re forcing the individuals to go back to the drug dealers , and the black market will flourish even more . ”
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE But this rests on the fundamental error that big-time drugs smugglers and dealers hawk illicit drugs to new consumers .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE It would put the drug dealers out of business . ”
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS It would put too many drugs on the street , we do n’t need that . ”
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__HARM It is the governments duty to protect the public from such dangerous drugs .
__label__HARM They must not lose sight of the fact that illicit drugs are dangerous - that is why the world agreed to restrict them .
__label__HARM The use of illicit drugs has been prohibited internationally since 1912 , an entire century , because of international agreement that the general community has a greater right to protect itself from the harms of illicit drug use than does an individual user to use a harmful substance recreationally .
__label__OTHER Currently there is still greater public support for the continued prohibiting of illicit drug use than there is for legalizing and regulating the use of these substances .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Drugs like heroin , cocaine , and amphetamines , which we may view now as unacceptable for legalization may eventually be sold over the counter at every corner drug store .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Perhaps the biggest opponents of legalizing drugs are the drug dealers themselves .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Other opponents of drug legalization cite health and social concerns .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Proponents like the Drug Policy Alliance claim that legalization should occur partially for “ health ” reasons .
__label__OTHER “ The thing that worries me most about legalization at this stage is the amount of commercialization that has occurred , ” said Rosalie Pacula , a researcher at the RAND Drug Policy Research Center in California .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Our concern about legalization is its effect on kids .
__label__OTHER These are the considerations that matter most to us , and to most parents , including — research shows — those favoring legalization .
__label__OTHER Legalization is n't one of them because there 's not public support for it .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Legalization wo n’t lead to increased use .
__label__OTHER The trend is moving toward legalization .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Further liberalizing the law will only make matters worse .
__label__OTHER The last thing we need is the burden that legalization will put on us .
__label__OTHER Legalization would be a nightmare .
__label__OTHER Legalization would reduce the risks and thus reduce the prices .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Legalizing it would reduce the prices , it 'd be taxed making a lot of money from that alone .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Legalization would mean a lower price ; thus , related crimes ( like theft ) would be reduced .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The budgetary implications of legalization would exceed those of decriminalization for three reasons , Miron and Waldock stated .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET They also indicate that legalization would produce far more cost savings than mere “ decriminalization ” which would entail repealing criminal penalties against simple possession , but retaining them against such acts as drug smuggling and selling .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS “ First , legalization eliminates arrests for drug trafficking in addition to arrests for simple possession , ” Miron and Waldock said .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Third , legalization allows taxation of drug production and sale . ”
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Just as important , drug legalization would translate into higher tax revenues generated by the sale of these newly-legalized products in the open commercial marketplace .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Drug legalization would yield tax revenues of $ 46.7 billion annually , assuming legal drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco , they said .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , for example , claims that legalization “ could yield California taxpayers over $ 1.2 billion per year ” in tax benefits .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET “ Tax revenue collected from marijuana sales would substantially outweigh the social costs of legalization . ”
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET It is true that taxing marijuana sales would generate some tax revenue , but the cost of handling the influx of problems resulting from increased use would far outweigh any gain made by marijuana ’s taxation .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET He said any new tax revenue from marijuana would be offset by higher public health costs .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__DRUG_POLICY The ballot measure to roll back the recreational marijuana industry , he said , would have a “ huge and tragic ” impact on the economy .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__ILLEGAL_TRADE But , walking out of the grocery store , Dossantos said he would vote against the ballot initiative because , he indicated , people will still use marijuana but will probably not drive somewhere else to buy it legally .
__label__HARM Voters considering legalizing marijuana on Election Day should look past vested interests ’ view that marijuana is safe .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HARM While President Obama seems to be coming around on the issue — he told the New Yorker that pot is not “ more dangerous than alcohol , ” and he even gave Colorado and Washington the thumbs-up to “ go forward ” with their experiment in legalization — his administration is still disappointingly conservative on marijuana .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Despite plenty of evidence to the contrary , the White House ’s official argument against legalizing marijuana still rests on the notion that legalizing and regulating pot will increase illicit drug use among young people .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY The White House drug czar argued that marijuana use is way up among young people in America and accused the marijuana industry of “ targeting our youth with things like funny cartoon characters . ”
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The White House issued a response to the New York Times , trotting out weak , largely debunked justifications for criminalization , focusing on marijuana ’s supposed social ills .
__label__OTHER But those problems are solvable , and would have long been dealt with had we as a nation not clung to the decision to make marijuana production and use a federal crime .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Do we really want to endorse the loss of millions more potentially productive Americans via Marijuana ?
__label__OTHER Around 40 % of Americans have already admitted to using marijuana .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS “ After three decades , criminalization has not affected general usage ; about 30 million Americans use marijuana every year , ” the Times points out .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Teen marijuana use has fallen slightly over the past five years , at a time when four states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana and 23 others allow medical use .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA There is already some early evidence that regulation would also help combat teen marijuana use , which fell after Colorado began broadly regulating medical marijuana in 2010 . ”
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY We need to provide a much better prevention and treatment infrastructure , which expanded access to marijuana and increasing teenage use will require .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Keeping marijuana illegal will undoubtedly keep many young people from using it .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Marijuana ’s illegal status “ keeps potential drug users from using ” marijuana in a way that no legalization scheme can replicate “ by virtue of the fear of arrest and the embarrassment of being caught . ”
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE “ By keeping marijuana illegal , we 've allowed some very dangerous and violent people to make a lot of money . ”
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__DRUG_ABUSE “ The money spent on government efforts to combat the illegal drug trade can be better spent on substance abuse and treatment for the allegedly few marijuana users who abuse the drug . ”
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Proponents of Question 2 say marijuana prohibition has helped drug cartels , and argue that taxing and regulating it would bring in money for schools and public services .
__label__ADDICTION __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Secondly , the harms of increased addictive drug use , which as previously outlined would be a consequence of legalization and its cheaper prices , far outweigh the current crime harms of prohibition .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM __label__HARM The same sort of analysis today would show that the harm caused by drug prohibition far outweighs the harm it prevents , even without taking into account the value to each individual of being sovereign over his own body and mind .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__DRUG_POLICY __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS This conclusion becomes more readily apparent when one distinguishes the harms suffered by society and its members directly attributable to the pharmacological effects of drug use upon human behavior , from those harms resulting from policies attempting to eradicate drug use .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM The argument is that drug use is a victimless crime and as such the government has no right to prohibit it or punish drug consumers , much like the government does not forbid overeating , which causes significantly more deaths per year .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM It is argued that persons should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies , including the recreational use of drugs , as long as they do not harm others .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Some consider use of the drug as morally wrong .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Even if the drug is shown to have harmful effects , it is still the right of every individual to decide what harms him or not .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Even if the drug is shown to be harmful , is n't it the right of every person to choose what harms him or her ?
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG This is particularly a problem since most people will not directly start abusing the harder drugs that are generally understood to be harmful .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE It 's only when you abuse the drug that problems start to occur .
__label__DRUG_POLICY If this does not happen , it will be because some nations fail to take the drug issue sufficiently seriously and pursue inadequate policies .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Now , countries all over the world have licensed the drug for medical purposes , and a few are going still further ( see article ) .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Some in the Legalization Lobby even claim such drugs have medical value , despite the lack of conclusive scientific evidence .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Certain states like California have brought initiatives to legalize the drug for at least medicinal purposes .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA This is the reason why certain states , such as California , have implemented initiatives for the legalization of the drug for medicinal purposes .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA There are places in California where it 's already legal for medicinal purposes .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA When it became illegal , its use as a medicine became restricted .
__label__DRUG_POLICY in Drug Use Should Be Decriminalized .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS The decriminalization of weed would allow more people to use the drug for its believed health benefits .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE It is believed that legalizing recreational weed will cut off a revenue stream for illegal drug traders .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Now , some people believe that the legalization of weed could be revenue generator in the form of new taxes applied to its sale and distribution .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The legalization of marijuana would create another item that could be taxed .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The argument that we can tax and regulate marijuana and derive income from it is false .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET “ Our group advocates the regulation and taxation of marijuana , the same way we do with alcohol ” he said .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__DRUG_POLICY Legalization advocates claim that marijuana and alcohol are mild intoxicants and so should be regulated similarly ; but as the experience of nearly every culture , over the thousands of years of human history , demonstrates , alcohol is different .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS It has been more than 40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana , inflicting great harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS There 's a reason pot was made illegal in the first place and quite frankly , the only reason alcohol and cigarettes are legal is because they 're so deeply ingrained in our society that we ca n't get rid of them .
__label__HARM The negative stigma of pot use has certainly made it seem like it 's worse , and since using the drug is still illegal , the fact that only people who are willing to break the law will smoke has inevitably made it associated with a " pothead " culture .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS People who go on to use harder drugs also tend to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol before trying the other substances plus with with our current stigma on pot only people who are predisposed to being a " outlaw drug user " are going to smoke pot .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__GATEWAY_DRUG However , opposition groups have explained this result as due to the fact that marijuana users are forced to purchase from illegal drug dealers , thus increasing their accessibility to ' harder ' drugs .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The dramatically lower level of marijuana use reflects its illegal status , not its appeal .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET And it if it works and it turns out that the presence of recreational marijuana makes them a more prosperous state ... well heck , we may just all want to reach out there and grab that .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__DRUG_POLICY LARRY WOLK : I think that allows law enforcement and the Department of Revenue to track better and to keep the marijuana here within the state without setting up the potential for importing or exporting .
__label__DRUG_POLICY " We need a safer system of marijuana sales in mass and the best way to do that is make it regulated and taxed and licensed , " Borghesani said .
__label__DRUG_POLICY By bringing marijuana into the legitimate business world , you can oversee production and regulate sales .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Every adult who wants to use marijuana is forced to purchase it in an illegal marketplace where there are other illegal products available .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Because marijuana has no “ currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States , ” it is a Schedule I drug that can not be bought , sold , possessed , or used without violating federal law .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Moreover , according to federal laws , marijuana remains an illegal “ Schedule I ” narcotic , which is considered to have “ no valid medical use . ”
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA The law conflicted with the Controlled Substances Act , which classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled dangerous substance and makes no exception for medical necessity .
__label__HARM Accordingly , federal law , representing the considered judgment of medical science and the nation ’s two political branches of government , takes the unequivocal position that marijuana is dangerous and has no significant beneficial uses .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Marijuana advocates claim that federal enforcement of drug laws , particularly in jurisdictions that allow the use of medical marijuana , violates states ’ rights .
__label__DRUG_POLICY A substantial majority of those who say marijuana should be legal ( 78 % ) do not think the federal government should enforce federal laws in states that allow its use .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Marijuana should stay illegal in the United States because if it is legalized , more people will smoke it , causing negative effects on health and families .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS If marijuana is legalized , people will think smoking marijuana is something we can do every day at anytime , which increases drug use .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY LARRY WOLK : The fact that marijuana is now more pervasive certainly would lead you to think that we 're going to see more kids have access to marijuana and marijuana products .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Supporters say marijuana is already available “ nearly everywhere , ” but without protections for children and consumers .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__DRUG_POLICY Despite the growing number of states with some form of medical law , cannabis is still difficult and risky to obtain for millions of people who could benefit from it .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Current law requires a doctor ’s prescription to procure marijuana ; full legalization would likely spark an even more acute increase in crime .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA If the amendment passes you could expect : - Patients with Cancer , Parkinson ’s , MS , ALS , AIDS , and PTSD to be eligible to use marijuana - Doctors would be allowed to prescribe marijuana within nine months .
__label__OTHER They point out marijuana would be doled out by budtenders , not medical professionals .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA They say that medical marijuana is a front for drug legalization and recreational use .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA If medical marijuana is truly helping , why not legalize it ?
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Medical marijuana is important to a lot of people .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA They say marijuana is a helpful medicine .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Marijuana is used to alleviate a lot of medical ailments .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG Marijuana is often used as a stepping-stone drug , leading to heroin , cocaine , or other harder drugs .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG A study of drug users in Amsterdam over a 10-year period conducted by Jan van Ours of Tilburg University in the Netherlands concluded that cannabis is not a stepping stone to using cocaine or heroin .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG They argue that the Dutch idea of going soft on cannabis dealers , thereby creating a " separation of markets " from hard drug dealers has failed to stem the initiation to drugs such as heroin , cocaine , and amphetamines , saying that , in 1998 , the Netherlands had the third highest cannabis and cocaine use in Europe .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__DRUG_POLICY According to a 2009 annual report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , the Dutch are among the lowest users of marijuana or cannabis in Europe , despite the Netherlands ' policy on soft drugs being one of the most liberal in Europe , allowing for the sale of marijuana at " coffee shops " , which the Dutch have allowed to operate for decades , and possession of less than 5 grams ( 0.18 oz ) .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Marijuana advocates often point to the Netherlands as a well-functioning society with a relaxed attitude toward drugs , but they rarely mention that Amsterdam is one of Europe ’s most violent cities .
__label__OTHER Amsterdam is the most famous place across the world that has effectively legalized pot .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS In Amsterdam , officials are in the process of closing marijuana dispensaries , or “ coffee shops , ” because of the crime associated with their operation .
__label__HARM The Marijuana Policy Project has called pot “ harmless . ”
__label__DRUG_POLICY In it , opponents of the initiative to legalize pot in Massachusetts conjure a gray , dystopian world with a pot shop on every corner ( “ Weed world ! ”
__label__OTHER In Massachusetts , one industry in particular has joined forces against the state ’s recreational marijuana proposal .
__label__DRUG_POLICY It is time to actually start controlling marijuana in Massachusetts through the type of taxed and regulated system that is working well in Colorado and other states .
__label__OTHER Pabon , the Colorado lawmaker , said he and his colleagues carefully studied the issue for months and were able to implement a recreational marijuana program with few major issues , making adjustments along the way as needed .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY William Huhn , who serves on the council for the group , came armed with a different set of statistics than Pabon , which showed an increase in youth marijuana use in Colorado since marijuana was legalized for recreational use .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY __label__GATEWAY_DRUG In the American Journal of Public Health , Andrew Golub and Bruce Johnson of the National Development and Research Institute in New York wrote that young people who smoked marijuana in the generations before and after the baby boomers did not appear to be likely to move on to harder drugs .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__GATEWAY_DRUG The “ gateway ” theory , which assumes adolescents who use marijuana will go on to use harder drugs , has been debunked many times but continues to rear its head in nearly all major drug policy discussions to this day .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG In the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use , it is indeed a “ gateway ” drug .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__GATEWAY_DRUG But because underage smoking and alcohol use typically precede marijuana use , marijuana is not the most common , and is rarely the first , “ gateway ” to illicit drug use .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG Not surprisingly , most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana first .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG As Scientific American points out , the studies that show people who use marijuana first before trying other drugs is correlation and not causation .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Most people understand that correlation and causation are not the same thing , but this fact seems lost on many politicians arguing against marijuana reform .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS To equate marijuana use with alcohol consumption is , at best , uninformed and , at worst , actively misleading .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HARM As you can see from a 2010 study published in the Lancet and reported on by the Economist , a team of drug experts in the U.K. assessed the combined harms to others and to the user of marijuana as less than the harms posed by alcohol or tobacco use .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS For example , the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( a division of the National Institutes of Health ) has released studies showing that use of marijuana has wide-ranging negative health effects .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS There are plenty of ways to achieve this goal , including a strong public education effort focused on the negative health effects of marijuana .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS At a time when we ’re concerned about our lack of academic achievement relative to other countries , legalizing marijuana will be disastrous .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS I think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today ... So , I think we 're just at the beginning , but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Anonymous says2013-04-21T18 :20:30.890 Report Post Marijuana should be legalized because it would save and make the government millions , alcohol and cigarettes are legal and they are way worse than marijuana so what are we waiting for legalize it !

__label__OTHER This Is Why Marijuana Should Be Legal Everywhere
__label__OTHER Why take the risk of legalizing marijuana ?
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Why run the risk of increasing marijuana use among young drivers ?
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Then there is the somewhat conflicting evidence on the dangers of people operating motor vehicles after using marijuana .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE These side effects are why several large studies find that that drivers high on marijuana are three to seven times more likely to be responsible for a car accident .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__DRUG_ABUSE __label__HARM In addition to anecdotal evidence , they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana , and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most " dangerous " drugs .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE One study showed that marijuana was the most prevalent illegal drug found in impaired or fatally injured drivers .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE In fact , study shows that weed is one of the most prevalent illegal drugs found in fatally injured and impaired drivers .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE REBUT : Obviously if/when weed becomes legal , it will be illegal to drive high , like Texting , and like drinking , or pills , etc .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS It 's funny , Weed makes you mellow out and happy and it 's illegal .
__label__OTHER But looking across the country , it ’s clear that self-interest — and the fear of lost profits — also fuels the effort to keep weed outlawed .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG Addiction treatment specialists believe that weed is a gateway drug that potentially introduces users to more serious illegal substances of abuse .
__label__ADDICTION It would be malpractice to say that cannabis is n't addictive .

__label__ADDICTION A marijuana withdrawal syndrome occurs , consisting of anxiety , depression , sleep and appetite disturbances , irritability , tremors , diaphoresis , nausea , muscle convulsions , and restlessness .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Research also shows a link between marijuana use and a motivational syndrome — characterized by reduced determination and drive .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__ADDICTION Chronic marijuana use is connected with what , in popular culture , has been called slacker behavior – increased risk of dropping out of school , lower achievement , diminished IQ and probably lower life satisfaction – not to mention addiction , physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms .

The difficult thing about marijuana addiction is some people , even though they 're addicted can do fine with it for many many years before they start to have difficultly , but eventually the high starts wearing off , people start smoking a lot more to try to get that high back and that 's when they descend into difficulties .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Marijuana users experience a high that alters the way they perceive things while under the influence .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Considering that marijuana is a drug , which by definition changes the way the human body works , its use would lead users to experience a high that alters their perception while under influence .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Experts say that marijuana increases the heart rate and the volume of blood pumped by the heart , but that poses a risk mostly to older users who already have cardiac or other health problems . ”
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS And marijuana affects people of all ages : Harvard University researchers report that the risk of a heart attack is five times higher than usual in the hour after smoking marijuana .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Marijuana use raises the heart rate from 20 to 100 percent for up to three hours after it has been smoked , increasing the risk of getting other health problems , such as arrhythmia , heart palpitations and heart attack .
__label__OTHER Many experts believe this improvement is not due to marijuana but is the outcome of taking deep breaths while inhaling the drug .

__label__HARM __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Our position is that California Proposition 215 was misrepresented under the misguided claim that there is substantial “ medical ” benefit from ingesting marijuana and that the harm and negative impacts would be negligible .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA In fact , this November , California voters will consider a ballot initiative – Proposition 19 – to legalize marijuana in the state ( in 1996 , California had passed a law to legalize medical marijuana ) .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA In 1996 , California passed the Compassionate Use Act , which legalized marijuana for medical use .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS There has been this movement statewide to decriminalize personal possession of marijuana at the county and city level , ” said Ben Pollara , the campaign manager for United for Care , the group who collected more than a million signatures to put medical marijuana on this year ’s ballot again .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA There have been a handful of polls over the last year and all of them show overwhelming support for medical marijuana .
__label__OTHER As recently as 2006 , just 32 % supported marijuana legalization , while nearly twice as many ( 60 % ) were opposed .
__label__OTHER Nearly six-in-ten Democrats ( 59 % ) favor legalizing the use of marijuana , as do 58 % of independents .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__DRUG_POLICY With four states and Washington , D.C. having passed measures to permit the use of marijuana for personal use , 27 % of supporters say legalization would lead to improved regulation of marijuana and increased tax revenues .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS The Administration — widely viewed as more liberal than any other in recent memory and , for a time , as embodying the hopes of pro-legalization activists — has weighed the costs and benefits and concluded that marijuana legalization would compromise public health and safety .
__label__OTHER Said National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ' St. Pierre : “ To have the Don Wirtshafters or progressive liberal columnists saying ‘ I ’m all for marijuana legalization , but I do n’t like this ballot initiative , ’ for activists , there were any number of reasons to oppose it . ”
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The campaign to make pot illegal was “ firmly rooted in prejudices against Mexican immigrants and African Americans , who were associated with marijuana use at the time . ”
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Others claim that marijuana was initially demonized partly due to fears of the Mexican immigrants associated with the drug .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG Even the gateway effect — the theory that cannabis leads to other drugs — was discarded long ago .
__label__HARM __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA The narrative of cannabis as a harmful drug has been dominant for so long , that many people had trouble accepting the plant ’s demonstrated medicinal effects .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE The real danger of marijuana is the violence of the underground drug economy created by prohibition .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS All three and state law enforcement groups believe legal marijuana is a public safety threat .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Overall , 62 % say that if marijuana were legal it would bother them if people used it in public ; just 33 % say this would not bother them .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM On the other hand , a majority of opponents of legalization ( 65 % ) say they would not be bothered if people used marijuana in their own homes ; virtually all supporters of legalization ( 97 % ) would not be bothered by this .

__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Even marijuana smoked at home can make it 's way to others , such as in multi-level apartment complexes .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Even smoking weed at home will allow the drug to make its way to others , especially if it is a multi-level apartment complex .

__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Its effect on the heart can make smoking the drug a high-risk activity for seniors or people living with cardiac conditions .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS The effect is amplified by the fact that many pot smokers inhale more deeply than cigarette smokers , increasing the amount of time the lungs are exposed to cancer-causing chemicals .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS This is because many pot smokers tend to inhale more deeply than cigarette smokers , which increases the amount of time the lungs are being exposed to chemicals that cause cancer .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Besides , cannabis smoking may lead to some respiratory problems , like increased phlegm and persistent cough .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Even if not causing all these issues , smoking pot can definitely aggravate a pre-existing condition .
__label__HARM So , there are lots of benefits to smoking pot with only a few non-beneficial issues .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Dr. Gupta reports that there are a host of medical advantages to using the drug , the most profound of which is staving off the debilitating effects of chemotherapy , which I agree places pot in a category of its own .
__label__ADDICTION __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY This is a major factor why marijuana is the number one drug causing young people to enter treatment and why there has been a substantial increase in the people in treatment for marijuana dependence .
__label__ADDICTION Marijuana dependence is also responsible for a large proportion of calls to drug abuse help lines and treatment centers .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Illegal drugs such as marijuana are responsible for a disproportionate share of violence and social decline in America .

__label__ADDICTION __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY No one knows the specifics of how marijuana decriminalization would work in practice or what measures would be necessary to prevent children , teenagers , criminals , and addicts from obtaining the drug .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Not only would legalizing marijuana open a lot of space in jail , it would bring many different ' types ' of people together .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Legalizing marijuana will end that violence , much like ending alcohol prohibition ended the violence of the illegal alcohol economy .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS However , Mike Meno , director of communications , Marijuana Policy Project , a legalization advocacy group in Washington DC , counters that ending prohibition would provide a major boost to law enforcement efforts .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Cannabis prohibition is quite costly , but so are other government initiatives .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Prohibition has enormous social costs .

__label__OTHER None of the dire prohibitionist predictions have come to pass .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Those ( including this newspaper ) who have argued that legalisation is better than prohibition will welcome the beginning of the end of the futile war on weed .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Nor has legalization pushed more people , including the young , into the clutches of demon weed .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE It is quite ironic , but perhaps the worst opponents of weed legalization are drug dealers themselves .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Legalisers , meanwhile , should open their eyes to the fact that the legal marijuana industry , which until now has only had to prove itself more worthy than organised criminals , now needs as much scrutiny as the other “ sin ” industries that defend their turf jealously .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS And whether the campaign contributions are coming from a pharmaceutical company or a prison guard union , he said , keeping marijuana illegal often boosts donors ’ bottom lines — and ensures that nonviolent users and suppliers will keep ending up behind bars .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE “ We get all of our money for these campaigns from individual donors , many people who lost family members to drug abuse , including from marijuana , ” Sabet said .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE While politicians blame drug users for being a major source of financing terrorists , no clear evidence of this link has been provided .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Many people argue that only drug dealers should be fought and not the drug users themselves .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Similarly , drug dealers today resolve their disputes through violence and intimidation , something which legal drug vendors do not do .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Once those involved in the narcotics trade have a legal method of settling business disputes , the number of murders and violent crime could drop .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE But through legalization , there will be open competition and lower prices , so drug cartels , which might include terrorists , would lose some or even all of their business .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Legalization would lower prices and open competition ; thus , drug cartels ( that might include terrorists ) would lose all or some of their business .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Drug dealers ( including some terrorists ) would lose most or all of their business .

__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS These include : minimal reduction in the consumption of controlled substances ; failure to reduce violent crime ; failure to markedly reduce drug importation , distribution and street-level drug sales ; failure to reduce the widespread availability of drugs to potential users ; failure to deter individuals from becoming involved in the drug trade ; failure to impact upon the huge profits and financial opportunity available to individual " entrepreneurs " and organized underworld organizations through engaging in the illicit drug trade ; the expenditure of great amounts of increasingly limited public resources in pursuit of a cost-intensive " penal " or " law-enforcement " based policy ; failure to provide meaningful treatment and other assistance to substance abusers and their families ; and failure to provide meaningful alternative economic opportunities to those attracted to the drug trade for lack of other available avenues for financial advancement .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The economic argument is also based on poor fiscal logic : any reduction in the cost of drug control ( due to lower law enforcement expenditure ) will be offset by much higher expenditure on public health ( due to the surge of drug consumption ) .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__DRUG_POLICY See , if you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view , the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Instead , the drug war , however well meaning its supporters , is in practice , a blatant assault on minorities and their economic mobility .

__label__DRUG_POLICY Many consider the War on Drugs an expensive failure .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS One of the strangest aspects of the war on drugs is how completely it has failed at reducing drug use , despite costing over $ 51 billion annually , according to the Drug Policy Alliance .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET In Colorado , for example , analysts suggest that taxing the drug could raise between $ 5 and $ 22 million annually .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET For instance , in Colorado , analysts recommend that taxing the drug could raise millions of dollars each year .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG That can lead to significant consequences because “ a 10-percent decrease in the price of marijuana would increase the prevalence of cocaine use by 4.4 to 4.9 percent . ”
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET In her testimony before the committee , Dr. Pacula stated that prohibition raises the cost of production by at least 400 percent and that legalizing marijuana would cause the price of marijuana to fall considerably — much more than the 50 percent price reduction incorporated into the state ’s revenue model .

__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Moderate use of marijuana does not appear to pose a risk for otherwise healthy adults .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Using and buying marijuana would still be illegal for anyone under 21 .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Under the measure , the age to legally consume marijuana in California would be 21 , but it would be naïve to assume that easier availability would not have a trickle-down impact and that the drug would find its way to those under legal age .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY In California , 62 percent of all marijuana treatment cases are already individuals under 21 .
__label__OTHER Millennials ( currently 18-34 ) have been in the forefront of this change : 68 % favor legalizing marijuana use , by far the highest percentage of any age cohort .

__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA In a blog entry on SFGate , writer David Downs explores the best strains of marijuana to help with insomnia .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS However , this is n’t true because marijuana worsens depression .
__label__HARM A big part of it may have to do with the fact that marijuana today is much stronger than it was in previous generations .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Marijuana use basically got smaller after it was legalized .
__label__OTHER It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the more legal and available marijuana becomes , the higher those numbers are going to go .
__label__HARM Researchers at the University of Mississippi ’s Natural Center for Natural Products Research have found that marijuana available today may be up to five times stronger than the stuff available back in the 1970s , ’80s , and ’90s .

__label__LEGAL_DRUGS " The U.S. government has argued that illegal drugs are " far more deadly than alcohol " saying " although alcohol is used by seven times as many people as drugs , the number of deaths induced by those substances is not far apart .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Legal drugs however , have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year : 480,000 from tobacco smoking - related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , during 2000 , there were 15,852 drug-induced deaths ; only slightly less than the 18,539 alcohol-induced deaths .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE No one has ever died of a marijuana overdose .
__label__HARM There 's never been a single death attributed solely to marijuana here in this country .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Research in some of the 25 states where medical marijuana is legal has found a possible protective effect against opioid overdose deaths .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA But in states where medical marijuana was legal , mortality linked to opioid use declined steadily in the years after implementation of the marijuana law – by almost 25 percent – compared to states where marijuana was not legally available .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS “ We are heartened to see that most illicit drug use is not increasing , non-medical use of prescription opioids is decreasing , and there is improvement in alcohol and cigarette use rates , ” NIDA Director Nora D.

__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__GATEWAY_DRUG Whereas millions of Americans consume moderate amounts of alcohol without ever “ moving on ” to dangerous drugs , marijuana use and cocaine use are strongly correlated .

__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Marijuana relieves stress , anxiety , depression , and pain by the active chemical THC acting on the system of the brain called the endocannabinoid ( ECB ) system .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA And medical marijuana users say they find it extremely beneficial when they feel anxious .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA For example people who are depressed use marijuana because they believe it will calm them down , and make them feel better .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Often , persons using marijuana erroneously believe that the drug is helping them combat these symptoms without realizing that actually marijuana is the cause of these effects .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Again , the argument is for people like Patsy Rodriguez , who believes marijuana is medicine .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG They also know that marijuana is the starter drug of choice for most criminals .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS To begin with , an astonishingly high percentage of criminals are marijuana users .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Perhaps cannabis users are more likely to be involved in other crimes , and arresting them for possession can nip a life of crime in the bud .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The most unfortunate of these arrestees have spent over a decade in prison , in some cases for nothing more than possession of cannabis for personal use .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS ONDCP state that the vast majority of inmates in state and federal prison for marijuana have been found guilty of much more than simple possession .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Allegations of marijuana crimes are becoming an endangered species in Colorado ’s courts .

__label__OTHER “ None of the busts I have done within Pueblo County with these home-grows have been anything related to recreational marijuana — except for the fact that they are here because we have become such a marijuana-friendly county .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Well-organized criminal groups and DTOs that produce domestic marijuana do so because of the high profitability of and demand for marijuana in the United States . ”
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE While such profits might not be possible if marijuana was legalized at the national level and these gangs were undercut by mass production , that is unlikely ever to happen .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE It is nonsensical to argue that these gangs will simply give up producing marijuana when it is legalized ; indeed , their profits might soar , depending on the actual tax in California and the economics of the interstate trade .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Nor does anyone really believe that the gangs will subject themselves to state and local regulation , including taxation .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Would decriminalization , especially if combined with taxation , expand market opportunities for the gangs and cartels that currently dominate drug distribution ?
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Drug decriminalization would remove the " glamorous Al Capone-type traffickers who are role-models for the young " .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Some proponents of decriminalization say that the financial and social costs of drug law enforcement far exceed the damages that the drugs themselves cause .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET “ Second , legalization saves prosecutorial , judicial , and incarceration expenses -- these savings are minimal in the case of decriminalization .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The benefits of criminalization are minuscule to nonexistent .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The Legislative Analyst ’s Office suggests that reduced criminal justice costs would mean a savings of tens of millions of dollars annually .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET For state and local governments , savings would result from : the reduction of expenditures of police resources by eliminating drug arrests ( thereby freeing police to chase after more dangerous and violent criminals ) ; the reduction in prosecutorial and judicial resources by eliminating drug-related prosecutions ; and the reduction in correctional resources by eliminating drug-related incarcerations , Miron added .

__label__DRUG_POLICY By far the best option is to commit itself seriously to the federal approach and pursue a strategy that attempts to prevent illegal drug use in the first place and reduce the number of drug users .
__label__ADDICTION __label__DRUG_POLICY The first step in any plan to alleviate this dreadful affliction should be the establishment of Federal control and dispensation – at cost – of habit-forming drugs .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS We have enough problems with alcohol and abuse of pharmaceutical products .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS But the truth is , alcohol has created so much dysfunction and destruction in our society , why would we want to introduce yet another drug that gets people high and back its usage with the power of Congress ?
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__LEGAL_DRUGS Those who would rather ban the drug should stop flogging the dead horse of prohibition and start campaigning for versions of legalisation that do the least harm ( just as the temperance movement these days lobbies for higher taxes on booze , rather than a ban ) .
__label__DRUG_POLICY The federal government should repeal the ban on marijuana .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__HARM Congress has the power to change the Controlled Substances Act and remove marijuana from Schedule I .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Congress has enacted a comprehensive regulatory scheme for restricting access to illicit drugs and other controlled substances .
__label__OTHER Cultivation , processing , transportation and use are illegal under the Federal Controlled Substances Act .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA In 2006 , the Supreme Court held in Gonzales vs. Raich that the Commerce Clause confers on Congress the authority to ban the use of marijuana , even when a state approves it for “ medical purposes ” and it is produced in small quantities for personal consumption .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Finally , the act authorizes the imposition and collection of taxes and fees associated with legalization of marijuana .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM To protect those that choose to remain smoke free , the state amended the Clean Air Act to include marijuana .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS People are going to smoke marijuana without getting in trouble or getting arrested .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS That is honestly an absurd assumption ; Many work forces if/when marijuana becomes legal wo n't allow their employees to be high ; and there may or may not be drug tests too.Whether or not some still do , they would n't go ' too stoned ' enough to loose their jobs .
__label__OTHER There are reasons why employers , including the United States government , prohibit marijuana use in the workplace .

__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Lauren Michaels , legislative affairs manager for the California Police Chiefs Association , which donated $ 20,000 to the campaign against Prop 64 , noted that her organization supports medical marijuana in the state but opposes the proposed recreational system because “ there ’s much less oversight and accountability for complying with state regulations . ”
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY “ Proposition 64 finally creates a safe , legal and comprehensive system for adult use of marijuana while protecting our children , ” said the ballot argument , whose signers include Donald O.

__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__ADDICTION “ Proposition 64 is an all-out assault on underprivileged neighborhoods already reeling from alcohol and drug addiction problems , ” said the opposition argument , whose signers include U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif . )
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY The proponents want a judge to reject or order substantial amendments to a number of arguments against Proposition 64 , including the contention that children would be exposed to advertisements promoting marijuana gummy candy and brownies .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Children could be exposed to ads promoting marijuana gummy candy and brownies , the same products blamed for a spike in emergency room visits in Colorado .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY And they argue that “ edibles ” — candy-like products infused with cannabis – could lure children into trying the drug .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Question 4 would authorize the advertising , promotion , and sale of high potency edible products like candies and sodas that are a particular risk for our kids and teens .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Regulations on edibles make sure dosages are safer , are in child-resistant , resealable packaging , and are clearly imprinted with a symbol identifying them .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Edibles and stronger strains help put the illegal dealers out of business , but they also risk encouraging more people to take the drug , and in stronger forms .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Advocates of legalization contend that by making the substance less profitable for criminals , it will decrease the violence associated with the trade .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Advocates contend that making the substance less profitable for criminals will result to a decrease in violence associated with the trade .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Really consider that this is much less about the legalization of a substance and much more about the commercialization of an industry .
__label__OTHER Unfortunately , the lack of legality in the U.S. and other countries has squashed the growth and development of these products .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE The starting-point should be to legalise only what is already available on the black market .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Yet Mason Tvert , a key Colorado and national legalization advocate , said the idea of eliminating a legal , regulated market as a way to undermine the black market is logically unsound .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE But as explained above , many black-market dealers would rationally choose to remain in the black market to avoid taxation and regulation .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__DRUG_POLICY A regulated and taxed system would move commerce from street dealers to licensed , taxpaying businesses under the control of state regulators and local authorities .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Creating systems for regulating manufacture , sale and marketing will be complex .
__label__DRUG_POLICY After all , there is nothing to regulate what is sold and no way to sue anyone for product liability .
__label__HARM Even without the federal prohibition , most reputable producers would not survive the tort liability from such a dangerous product .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE If the product were outlawed there the mob would gladly step in .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE With drugs prohibited , sellers are " underground " and therefore nearly impossible to control .
__label__DRUG_POLICY To effectively regulate the sellers of drugs so as to ensure that they only sell drugs to adults , drugs must be legalized , and the sellers licensed .
__label__DRUG_POLICY The FDA or others could regulate the quality and safety of drugs .
__label__DRUG_POLICY “ FDA ’s drug approval process requires well-controlled clinical trials that provide the necessary scientific data upon which FDA makes its approval and labeling decisions . ”
__label__DRUG_POLICY Ironically , the current drug control regulations hamper access to controlled opiate medications for therapeutic use .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Many patients are unable to access morphine , methadone or an equivalent opioid .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Opium also has medicinal benefits , and no one is saying that we should legalize heroin .
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG __label__GATEWAY_DRUG Step-by-step , more drugs will gain acceptance , with advocacy of the legalization of harder drugs .
__label__DRUG_POLICY The decision by America ’s most reputable paper to take such a stand shows both the overwhelming evidence in support of legalization and the shifting status quo toward acceptance of new drug policies .
__label__OTHER Release 's actions have included challenging such stigmatisation with its " Nice People Take Drugs " advertising campaign .
__label__ADDICTION Likewise , the proposal that addictive drugs should be legalized , regulated and opened to " free market dynamics " is immediately belied by the recognition that the drug market for an addict is no longer a free market – it is clear that they will pay any price when needing their drug .
__label__HARM Drug Free Australia for example argues " That illicit drugs are inherently harmful substances is attested by the very nomenclature of the ' harm reduction ' movement .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE " Drug Free Australia claims that other causes of death such as suicide , murder and accidents are an effect of the drug themselves , not of their purity or otherwise .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE Drug overdoses already outnumber gunshot deaths in America and are approaching motor vehicle crashes as the nation ’s leading cause of accidental death .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Six times as many homicides are committed by people under the influence of drugs , as by those who are looking for money to buy drugs .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals , engaging in both property and violent crime .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Because of drug-related arrests , people who have committed or are likely to commit more serious crimes can be taken off the streets .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS If such people are in prison because of drug charges , they are n't able to go out and commit other crimes .

__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Drug busts often trap young people in a flawed system that turns them into lifelong criminals .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Unless a person is wealthy , he or she must often resort to robbery and other crimes to generate the money needed to buy the drugs .
__label__ADDICTION When people develop drug habits or addictions , they must somehow come up with the money to support their cravings .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__ADDICTION When people are addicted to cannabis , cocaine and alcohol the drug they have the most difficult time giving up is the cannabis .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Like sex , alcohol , or cigarettes , marijuana is one of life 's little pleasures for some people .
__label__OTHER Marijuana is known for ' opening your eyes ' to many of the corrupt ways of the economy .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Studies show that marijuana helps decrease the pressure inside your eye .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Besides , some studies suggest that marijuana use decreases IQ level .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY " A continued area of concern is the high rate of daily marijuana smoking seen especially among 12th graders , because of marijuana ’s potential deleterious effects on the developing brains of teenagers , ” NIDA 's Volkow said in a statement .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__DRUG_ABUSE __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Teen use has stayed flat , motor vehicle accidents involving marijuana have not increased , millions of dollars in new revenues have gone to schools , job training programs and other worthy causes , and thousands of new jobs have been created .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY The more weed that teens consume at a younger age , the more problems they tend to have later in life .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__ADDICTION __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY As we ’ve seen with alcohol and tobacco , imposing a minimum age will probably not be enough to prevent a spike in teenage use and addiction .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Though more adults are smoking pot , the MTF data suggests that teens are n't following suit .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Would you want your kids regularly smoking pot ?
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Moreover , we all recognize that smoking is a dirty habit that makes you die younger while drinking is a potentially dangerous habit that leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths per year , but we want to condone pot use on top of that ?
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS We have been fighting for 50 years to save people ’s lives by restricting tobacco use .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS But neither are there such answers about tobacco or alcohol , and we believe that on every level — health effects , the impact on society and law-and-order issues — the balance falls squarely on the side of national legalization .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__ADDICTION __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__DRUG_ABUSE __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY We can not ignore the negative effects that legalization would have on under-age use and addiction , highway safety , treatment costs , mental health problems , emergency room admissions , workplace accidents and productivity , and personal health .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS If one views incarceration as a public health issue , then legalization could have a positive result .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET In sum , legalization would put additional strain on an already faltering economy .
__label__OTHER “ If legalization wins , it creates an environment where a small number of people are going to get rich , ” Sabet said .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Legalising it deprives organised crime of its single biggest source of income , while protecting and making honest citizens of consumers .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Critics assert that legalization would remove this central source of support for terrorism .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE This has allowed criminal , paramilitary and guerrilla groups to reap huge profits , exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM __label__NATIONAL_BUDGET It has caused countless casualties , wasted taxpayer dollars , promoted discrimination and taken away basic human liberties .
__label__OTHER The result could save lives while taking pressure off of law enforcement .
__label__OTHER This would save lives while taking the weight off from law enforcers .
__label__OTHER This just makes the resumption of a normal crime-free life all the more difficult .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY It is only giving a bad idea to teens , parents , and families .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY So that argument to me that you 're going to keep it out of the hands of kids is completely illogical .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY We 're fighting for the emotional well-being of our children .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY You really want your kids on that ?
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Any time you make something legal , you increase the accessibility to children .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Legalization will increase the number of underage users .
__label__OTHER Backers believe this time around they will get the votes needed to legalize it .
__label__OTHER But , there would be an even larger cost to making it legal .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET This legalize and tax argument is un-ethical and uneconomical .
__label__DRUG_POLICY That for adults , it should be taxed , regulated and controlled . "
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM Libertarians may ask why cannabis , which has no known lethal dose , should be regulated at all for adults who can make free , informed decisions .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Our current federal laws , which treat cannabis as equivalent to cocaine and heroin , mostly teach teenagers that the government is completely unrealistic on matters of drug policy .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS If law enforcement agencies wanted to find a good “ minor offense ” correlate for violent , dangerous crimes , marijuana use does n’t make a lot of sense .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__HARM This may require changes in drug policy , and perhaps in sentencing guidelines for marijuana users charged with simple possession , but simply legalizing a harmful drug — that is , giving up — is not a responsible option .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS To this end , I am very against the legalization of marijuana , but not against the decriminalization of the drug .
__label__OTHER Now is the time to think about it because although it 's easy to thoughtlessly legalize a drug like marijuana , when things go predictably wrong down the road , it will be a lot harder to put the genie back in the bottle than people seem to think .
__label__OTHER It is as clear now as it has ever been : the time has come to end marijuana prohibition .
__label__OTHER All across the globe , the old resolve against cannabis is crumbling .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Researchers at Duke University , King ’s College , London , and the University of Otago in New Zealand found that long-term cannabis use — notably among those who started as adolescents — leads to long-term and probably permanent decline in mental abilities , including reasoning and memory .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Also youth combine tobacco with marijuana use .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY The relationship between pricing and rates of youth substance use is well-established with respect to alcohol and cigarette taxes .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY " Seventy-five dollars is n't anything compared to the cost of a child becoming addicted to any substance , including marijuana , " she told New Times .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY " The acceptance of a substance that can cause harm is the wrong message to send to children and adolescents , " he said , " and we know that adolescents in the risk-taking times of their lives really perceive the risks of marijuana as having declined . "
__label__HARM __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY " This would undermine a fundamental lesson that our schools , social service programs and parents teach our children : that taking drugs is bad for you . "
__label__GATEWAY_DRUG Second one : " One of the main reasons why it would be just plain stupid to legalize one of the most used drugs in our nation is because it leads to hard drugs , such as cocaine and heroine . "
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS There is no correlation between the harshness of drug laws and the incidence of drug-taking : citizens living under tough regimes ( notably America but also Britain ) take more drugs , not fewer .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many " unintended negative consequences " of drug enforcement .
__label__OTHER Less serious offenses , such as failing to complete a census form , may also attract a criminal record , so the contention that criminalizing drug use is draconian can be seen as overstatement .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Anyone who commits drug-related felonies is n't likely to be constrained in committing other felonies , such as robbery , rape , murder , etc .
__label__ADDICTION Drug addiction , like prostitution , and like liquor , is not a police problem ; it never has been , and never can be solved by policemen .
__label__ADDICTION “ The more the barriers there are ( cops or the hassle or the fear of dying from an overdose ) the less likely you are to get addicted , ” according to Van Deventer ( Legalizing Drugs , pg 68 ) .

__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA There are medical benefits such as the those for cancer patients .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA The health and good benefits includes , treating Alzheimer ’s , Glaucoma , and cancer .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Marijuana can help treat Alzheimer ’s by one of the major components called cannabidiol ( CBD ) .
__label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Studies suggest that CBD may reverse some of the cognitive impairments of Alzheimer ’s disease .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Several other large studies conclude that use can cause impairment of cognitive ability at any age , though to a lesser degree .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY The negative effects of it includes , slowed reaction time , and brain damage on young users who are still in major development of their brain until the age of at least 25 .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Heavy recreational use of cannabinoids can adversely affect the brains of young people – that is , pre-adolescents to those in their early 20s – probably related to the continuing development of brain structures and functions in that age group .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY At the same time , he is particularly concerned about the adverse impact of heavy recreational cannabinoid use on brain development and mental illness expression in younger people .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Dr. Strouse has seen both the benefits and risks of cannabis use and is well-versed in the emerging scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of cannabinoids in a variety of medical conditions and pain states , as well as epidemiologic evidence of legalized marijuana ’s connection to a reduction in prescription drug use and opioid-related deaths .
__label__OTHER Colin Souney of Helping Educate Misinformaed People Connecticut , talks about why marijuana should be legalized .
__label__DRUG_POLICY HARTFORD – Advocates of reforming Connecticut 's drug laws are hoping for a big crowd at an informational hearing Tuesday on the legalization of marijuana .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET But inside the Legislative Office Building Tuesday the marijuana legalization movement came ready to make a fiscal argument : If Connecticut does n't act , another state in New England will , and lawmakers are leaving millions of dollars in potential revenue on the table at a time when the state is hurting .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Two years ago the legislature 's nonpartisan fiscal office said Connecticut could see $ 25 to $ 55 million in annual revenue from marijuana taxes .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET The state collected $ 70 million in taxes on pot from June 2014 to July 2015 , $ 30 million more than amount raised from taxes on alcohol .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Statewide revenue from dedicated pot taxes easily topped the money from alcohol taxes .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS An enormous amount of money is raised through government taxation of alcohol , cigarettes , and other " sins " .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET This $ 30 billion figure rises dramatically once other issues , such as the economic impact of holding 400,000 prisoners on prohibition violations , are factored in .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Taken together , this is less than 10 percent of the over $ 185 billion in alcohol-related costs from health care , lost productivity , and criminal justice .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS In the end , despite alcohol ’s costs to bodily health , and the alarming effects it can have on behavior , it was determined , rightly , that criminalizing alcohol did more harm than good .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS But alcohol leads to drunk driving accidents , deaths in the process and rapes of women , etc. and it 's legal .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE While drunk driving is a major problem in society , despite all the stiff penalties and education , equally dangerous is “ driving high ” , but this is more difficult to detect , unless the user has been smoking in the car .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol ( such as alcoholism , cystisis , domestic violence , brain and liver damage ) .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS Countless articles in medical journals and other scientific literature confirm the positive health effects of moderate alcohol consumption .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS There are several possible explanations for alcohol ’s unique status : For most people , it is not addictive ; it is rarely consumed to the point of intoxication ; low-level consumption is consistent with most manual and intellectual tasks ; it has several positive health benefits ; and it is formed by the fermentation of many common substances and easily metabolized by the body .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Its effects are mostly euphoric and mild , whereas alcohol turns some drinkers into barroom brawlers , domestic abusers or maniacs behind the wheel . ”
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS They decided that these unintended side effects far outweighed whatever harms Prohibition prevented by discouraging drinking .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS These same things happened when alcohol was legalized .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS When alcohol use was outlawed during prohibition , it gave rise to gang warfare and spurred the formation of some of the most well known criminals of the era , among them the infamous Al Capone .
__label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS In the 1930s , marijuana was linked publicly in several research studies , and via a famed 1936 film named " Reefer Madness , " to crime , violence , and anti-social behavior .
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS 1944 , New York Academy of Medicine - Report finds that marijuana does not " induce violence , insanity or sex crimes . "
__label__HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS Studies commissioned by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson concluded that " marijuana use did not induce violence . "
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Alaska 's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state 's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally .
__label__HARM In 2000 , there were six times as many emergency room mentions of marijuana use as there were in 1990 , despite the fact that the number of people using marijuana is roughly the same .
__label__HARM In 2008 , marijuana alone was involved in 375,000 emergency room visits .
__label__DRUG_ABUSE There are reasons why marijuana emergency room admissions are reported at the rate of 1,250 a day and 455,000 a year , and why highway crashes double for marijuana users .
__label__HARM Figures regarding emergency room mentions of marijuana use can be misleading too , as " mention " of a drug in an emergency department visit does not mean that the drug was the cause of the visit .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM The nuisance caused by the powerful odor of mature marijuana plants is already striking California municipalities .
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM The City Council of Chico , California , has released a report detailing the situation and describing how citizens living near marijuana cultivators are disturbed by the incredible stink emanating from the plants .
__label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY Would existing zoning laws prohibit marijuana cultivation in residential neighborhoods , and if not , what measures would growers have to undertake to keep children from the plants ?
__label__PERSONAL_FREEDOM __label__DRUG_POLICY Besides granting the freedom to possess or grow personal amounts of marijuana for all Arizonans 21 and older , the measure would set up a limited retail-store system and new regulatory agency to provide oversight .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Several other well-known proponents of cannabis freedom in Arizona , including Kathy Inman and Dr. Jeffrey Singer , who worked to get Arizona 's medical-marijuana and drug-law reform initiative passed in 1996 , wrote arguments sponsored by the campaign .

__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY __label__MEDICAL_MARIJUANA Insys has said it opposes legalization because federal regulators have not approved marijuana for medical use and because the proposed law “ fails to protect the safety of Arizona ’s citizens , and particularly its children . ”

__label__HARM Vice president Rich Copp says Partners is concerned about what it 's heard about legalization in other states , " particularly with the uncertainty around the safety of dosing of marijuana present in edible forms .
__label__OTHER Growers in this area worry that legalized pot will reduce the value of their cash crop – placing the region 's economy at some risk .
__label__OTHER Pot is also the leading cash crop in at least a dozen states , including California and North Carolina .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Marijuana is already believed to be the nation 's number one cash crop , exceeding the combined value of wheat and corn .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET Almost $ 1 billion of medical and recreational marijuana was sold in Colorado in 2015 , bringing in more than $ 135 million in taxes and fees , with $ 40 million going toward school construction .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET And , Pace said , almost $ 4 million in annual tax revenue has gone to college scholarships , 4H and Future Farmers of America efforts , medical marijuana research at Colorado State University Pueblo , among other areas .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET A significant portion of the local economy of the Emerald Triangle is already connected to marijuana , which generates about a $ 500-million in untaxed income every year , according to Beth Wilson , professor of economics at Humboldt State University .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE “ Mexican drug cartels , which are gaining power , currently generate about 60 percent of their revenue by selling marijuana in the U.S , giving them a virtual monopoly on this very lucrative trade , ” he said .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE This drives people in the relatively poor countries of Colombia , Peru , Bolivia and Brazil to break their own laws in organising the cultivation , preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States .
__label__OTHER In some regions , farmers ' coca and other crops are frequently destroyed by U.S.-sponsored eradication treatments ( usually sprayed from the air with varying degrees of discrimination ) , whether or not the farmers directly supply the cocaine trade , thereby destroying their livelihoods .
__label__OTHER The net effect can be a depression of prices for all crops , which can both make the farmer 's livelihood more precarious , and make the cocaine producers ' coca supplies cheaper .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE __label__DRUG_POLICY The war on drugs and prohibitionist policies only serve to aggravate the already detrimental impacts of narco-trafficking on Central American forests .
__label__DRUG_POLICY __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Already , California is suffering crime , dislocation , and increased drug use under its current regulatory scheme .
__label__DRUG_POLICY No doubt , those entities will pass a variety of laws in an attempt to deal with the many problems caused by legalization , unless the local laws are struck down by California courts as inconsistent with the underlying initiative , which would be even worse .
__label__DRUG_POLICY At best , that patchwork of laws , differing from one locality to another , will be yet another unintended and predictable problem arising from legalization as envisioned under this act .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE Legalization would create proper means to settle disputes .
__label__ILLEGAL_TRADE But with legalization , proper means to settle disputes would be created .
__label__OTHER While long on rhetoric , the legalization movement , by contrast , is short on facts .
__label__NATIONAL_BUDGET __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS The paper of record is continuing to make the case for legalization over a series of editorials , addressing the social costs , racist history and wasted resources from cannabis prohibition .
__label__LEGAL_DRUGS __label__COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS Borghesani added , “ What I think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that ( marijuana ) prohibition has done to people of color , to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because they ’ve been arrested . ”
__label__OTHER This year , Donilon said , the Archdiocese has identified the legalization campaign as a threat to its sprawling umbrella of services — from antihomelessness programs , to food pantries , to parochial schools .
__label__OTHER “ It ’s a recognition that , if passed , the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes , our ministries . ”
__label__DRUG_POLICY But the act does not even purport to address the fundamental constitutional infirmity that it would be in direct conflict with federal law .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Increased acceptance in the states would likely ramp up pressure on the federal government to lift its decades-long ban .
__label__DRUG_POLICY Repeal , they say , would cost more than a thousand jobs .
