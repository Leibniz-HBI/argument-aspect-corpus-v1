__label__COSTS In a recent estimate , the UK government calculated that cleaning up the country ’s ageing nuclear facilities will exceed 73 billion pounds ( USD 100 billion ) .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ENERGY_POLICY She said her party rules out conceeding this issue to the SNP , in the event of any coalition or policy negotiations , and that Labour stands by its pledge made in the last government that new nuclear is needed to help the UK to reduce its carbon emissions and meet future electricity demand .
__label__WEAPONS Today , nuclear energy is used to make weapons .
__label__RENEWABLES Instead , Jacobson proposes that the world overcome its sociopolitical barriers and install 80 percent renewables by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Dishonest representation of the potential of other low carbon alternatives does not add extra credibility to MSR and it does not help the sense of urgency among developers of MSR to claim that there is no real competition .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Nuclear power , by virtue of its large size , centralised production of electricity and dependence on experts , was suitable for control by state bureaucracies .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY While none of the safety problems harmed plant employees or the public , they occurred with alarming frequency — more than once a month — which is high for a mature industry .
