__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS If we want to stop using fossil fuels it will likely contain a nuclear component , along with wind and solar .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENERGY_POLICY The main argument for not including existing nuclear power plants – as well as electricity from large hydropower dams – in clean air mandates and subsidies is that contributions from these conventional sources would dwarf new renewable generation , which the federal government wishes to encourage .
__label__RENEWABLES Scientific studies too numerous to mention show repeatedly that wind , solar , geothermal , and tidal sources of clean energy are abundant and easily accessible .

__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS One of Caldicott ’s more outrageous contentions – that she calls into play as a fallback position and that belies her claim to being “ knowledgeable , ” or to being “ truthful and honest ” – is that human-made radiation is qualitatively different from natural background radiation .

__label__ENERGY_POLICY It is futile to expect the government on its own - whatever its platform may be - to readily oppose aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle .
__label__WEAPONS Use of nuclear power by the U.S. will encourage nuclear proliferation by third-world countries and often leads to nuclear weapon development and the risk of nuclear war .

__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Nuclear power threatens the environment and people ’s health .
__label__RENEWABLES At present , there is a worrisome groundswell of opinion that renewable energy is sufficient to hit that target , Wigley of the University of Adelaide said .

__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE Go look up some of Will Saletan ’s fantastic work on this topic on SLATE and I think you ’ll very quickly recognize the same anti-science , caution-in-spite-of-evidence to-the-point-of-hysteria patterns that underpin the nuclear power debate .

__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE The thinking is that big corporations are motivated only to distort the truth , minimize legal exposure , withhold information , and to make money at the expense of the public good if necessary .
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES As nuclear plants have to be run continuously as close to full capacity as possible to even come close to justifying their enormous construction , operating , and decommissioning costs , they compete not just for funding , but they compete directly with clean renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar , which are similarly best operated on a continual basis .
__label__WEAPONS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__WASTE Moreover , with the clear connection to nuclear weapons production , alongside many unresolved questions surrounding long-term waste management and the decommissioning of old plants , there are more than enough compelling arguments against nuclear power — in addition to the potential for terrifying accidents — to justify shutting them down now .

__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Uranium mine rehabilitation ensures that these are safe , stable and will cause no harm .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT When they are not maintained , have structural flaws or were improperly installed , a nuclear reactor could release harmful amounts of radiation into the environment during the process of regular use .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Their fuel becomes very radiation hard ( strong Gamma emitter ) such that a major accident or spill would be extremely hazardous to clean .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Similar future catastrophes could be the result of an accident , sabotage by disgruntled employees or a terrorist attack .
__label__COSTS Building nuclear power plants takes too long It can take between 20 to 30 years to move from the planning to the opening of a nuclear reactor .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It is dangerous and why cant they save it for when the world runs out of the power we are using now ?
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY April 16th , 2006 : " Nuclear reactors are vulnerable to terrorist attack .

__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY There is also the potential for a nuclear reactor disaster , such as the explosion and meltdown that occurred at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986 or the partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979 .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS In fact , national radiation protection standards fall short of protecting those most vulnerable to the harmful effects of radiation , basing their evaluation on impacts to a “ standard ” healthy , young , white adult male .

__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY There would be environmentalism in the USSR , but not until the terrible accident that took place in Chernobyl in 1986 ( 3 , p4 ) .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Of course , the high-profile 1986 Chernobyl accident — the poster child for catastrophic nuclear meltdown — together with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ( a consequence of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ) have done little to increase public confidence in nuclear power .

__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE A major useful source to correct the fear mongering and distortions surrounding radiation – in particular exposing the erroneous linear-no-threshold ( LNT ) assumption used by all regulatory agencies ( outside of France ) as the basis of their regulatory policies – is to be found at the website of Scientists for Accurate Radiation Information ( SARI ) , an international organization of some 80 scientists , physicians , and others from 14 different countries around the world , to which we both belong .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY When these safety systems are properly installed and maintained , they function adequately .
__label__WASTE Nuclear power plants create a lot of low-level radioactive waste as transmitted parts and supplies .

__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It can also cause damage to living things in and around the plants .
__label__WASTE There is still no licensed repository to store all this waste in the United States , and the one site that has been proposed for decades at Yucca Mountain in Nevada has shown numerous problems according to critics , such as vulnerability to earthquakes , " and it is very uncertain if that site will ever be built or not , " Nogee said .
__label__RELIABILITY This results in fewer brownouts or other power interruptions .
__label__RENEWABLES When there are so many cheaper , safer , cleaner and more sustainable alternatives , why the debate ?

__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The awesome destructiveness seen at Hiroshima is one of the products of nuclear fission .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT So scientists have now turned their attention to what would be needed after 2030 to meet a 2 C goal : an energy system transformation that emits less carbon .
__label__COSTS __label__WASTE There are many other reasons to be against nuclear power : the cost overruns , the fact that no country has a fully developed or workable plan — or in most cases any plan — for what to do with the nuclear waste that is piling up alongside the nuclear reactors .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Additionally , a nuclear power plant can not operate without routinely releasing radioactivity into the air and water through the normal operation of nuclear reactors .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT All reactors release radiation into the air , water and soil .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It produces no harmful greenhouse gases , isolates its waste from the environment , and requires less area to produce the same amount of electricity as other sources .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__PUBLIC_DEBATE The result is that the vast majority of voters are not even aware that different types of nuclear reactor are possible , some types of which would eliminate or greatly reduce the legitimate objections to our current LWR technology .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES Studies have shown that what life-cycle emissions that the plants do give off are on par with renewable energy sources such as wind power .
