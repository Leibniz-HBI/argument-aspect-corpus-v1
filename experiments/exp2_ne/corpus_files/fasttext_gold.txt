__label__WEAPONS In addition , the same know-how used to design nuclear power plants can to a certain extent be used to build nuclear weapons ( nuclear proliferation ) .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Nuclear power was attractive to governments and state bureaucracies for several reasons .
__label__WEAPONS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Terrorism : The opportunity for theft by terrorists of nuclear materials usable in even a " dirty bomb " would susbtantially increase if nuclear power is expanded .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Nuclear power has already been subsidized to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars over the past 50 years .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT However , it came up against a world of a growing environmental movement and the 1970 's and 1980 's saw a slowdown in building of reactors and a general negative perception of their use ( 3 , p3-5 ) .

__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE It is a a whole distraction , and people should know better than to propose nuclear energy , because people who are working in this field know it is not going to go anywhere ,  he said .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The rise of environmental consciousness and the fears of nuclear fallout have done much to militate against widespread enthusiasm for nuclear energy .
__label__WEAPONS In practice , there is no way to segregate nuclear technologies employed for “ peaceful ” purposes from technologies that may be employed in weapons — the former may be , and have been , transformed into the latter . "
__label__WEAPONS Hence , an important argument underpinning the anti – nuclear power movement has always been its insistence that an umbilical cord links military and civilian nuclear programs , which , as a consequence , drives a new and even more terrifying arms race .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE As the nuclear power issue has been widely debated , it has become obvious to many people that the expertise of pro-nuclear scientists and engineers is tied to vested interests .
__label__WEAPONS There are four states with undeclared stockpiles of nuclear weapons developed from civil programs , and it is no coincidence that they are in some of the most volatile , militarized — and hence dangerous — areas of the world : Israel , Pakistan , India , and North Korea .

__label__WEAPONS Moreover , plutonium , a necessary component of nuclear weapons and the most life-destroying element known to humanity , is not an element that occurs naturally on earth .
__label__COSTS __label__WASTE There are many other reasons to be against nuclear power : the cost overruns , the fact that no country has a fully developed or workable plan — or in most cases any plan — for what to do with the nuclear waste that is piling up alongside the nuclear reactors .

__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT All reactors release radiation into the air , water and soil .
__label__WASTE thirdly where would we put all the waste from the nuclear power .
__label__WASTE Nuclear power plants create a lot of low-level radioactive waste as transmitted parts and supplies .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Therefore , expensive solutions are needed to protect mother earth from the devastating effects of nuclear energy .
__label__WASTE [ Response :] Within 40 years , used fuel has less than one-thousandth of the radioactivity it had when it was removed from the reactor .
__label__WASTE Whenever nuclear waste is buried , risks are created for future generations , as there is no 100 % reliable way to store radioactive materials .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT However , its environmental and social impact is huge .
__label__WASTE Second , spent Uranium has to be disposed of and dealt with at one point even if it is reprocessed and the radioactivity of it remains .
__label__WASTE Nuclear waste radioactivity dissipates over time .
__label__WASTE This includes 20-30 tons of high-level radioactive waste from each of the current 103 nuclear reactors in the U.S. each year .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__WASTE This waste is actually a cocktail of chemicals such as Cesium-137 , Iodine-129 , Strontium-90 , and Plutonium-239 , each radioactive and cancer-causing .
__label__WEAPONS __label__WASTE On top of that , the power released from splitting atoms can also be used to make nuclear bombs , and nuclear power produces radioactive waste which needs to be stored somewhere , not that many people want it stored near them .
__label__WASTE Although the spent fuel is highly radioactive at the moment it is brought out of the reactor , this same characteristic means that it rapidly loses radioactivity .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Additionally , a nuclear power plant can not operate without routinely releasing radioactivity into the air and water through the normal operation of nuclear reactors .

__label__WASTE Uranium tailings retain almost all their radioactivity , which continues for hundreds of thousands of years .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY U.S. nuclear experts question whether filling the reactors with hundreds of tons of water is n’t also raising the possibility of a rupture in the containment vessel , which would trigger a massive further release of radioactivity .
__label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY While nuclear still plays a major role in the EU , aging facilities present financial and security risks .
__label__WASTE Each link in the nuclear fuel chain releases radiation , starting with drilling for uranium ; it then continues for generations because nuclear waste includes plutonium that will remain toxic for thousands of years .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Radiation levels in the surrounding water have soared as high as 7.5 million times the legal limit while elevated radiation levels are now being detected in the United States .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Their fuel becomes very radiation hard ( strong Gamma emitter ) such that a major accident or spill would be extremely hazardous to clean .
__label__WASTE Yes I know that it would take millions of years for the radioactive waste to stop being radioactive but it could be stored in a safe place .
__label__WASTE Nuclear reactors produce large amounts of long-lasting , deadly radioactive waste .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__WASTE * Shipping nuclear waste internationally poses an increased potential threat to interception to terrorism ( though this has not happened yet with any of the waste shipped by other countries ) .
__label__WASTE As if this were n't bad enough , nuclear power plants produce a great deal of low-level radioactive waste in the form of radiated parts and equipment .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY These meltdowns are still pouring radiation pollution across the Japanese landscape .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__WASTE Look at the cons associated with conventional nuclear reactors … high operating pressure and temperature , massive size of containment structures , waste by products , potential for catastrophic systems failure , ad nauseam and they built them anyway !
__label__WASTE Because they know that if you recycle fuel rods , you dont have a waste problem and they lose an argument against nuclear .
__label__WASTE One of the greatest fears of nuclear power is that the radioactive waste that results can remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years .
__label__WASTE And many environmentalists continue to give nukes the stink-eye becauseâ € ” as the Lantern noted in an earlier columnâ € ” after 50 years we still do n't have a long-term plan for storing high-level commercial nuclear waste .
__label__WASTE This presents risks to the populations that exist on the route to these waste areas .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The studies also inform us that up to 2,646 lb of the highly radioactive and long-lasting isotope caesium-137 would be released into the atmosphere , contaminating Britain , Ireland , continental Europe and beyond , making swathes of the country uninhabitable and causing more than two million cancers .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Transport of uranium and other radioactive material is hazardous .
__label__WASTE The nuclear industry is responsible for horrific wastes which will endure as a nightmare for our grandchildren .
__label__WASTE More than 58,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent fuel already has accumulated at reactor sites around the U.S. for which there currently is no permanent repository .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__WASTE One design , the Generation IV Integral Fast Reactor , goes even further in providing an answer to the waste problem through recycling and use of all the energy available in the fuel .
__label__WEAPONS __label__WASTE During the operation of nuclear power plants , radioactive waste is produced , which in turn can be used for the production of nuclear weapons .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__WASTE __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Radiation is n’t easily dealt with , especially in nuclear waste and maintenance materials , and expensive solutions are needed to contain , control , and shield both people and the environment from its harm .
__label__WASTE April 16th , 2006 : " [ Claim :] Nuclear waste will be dangerous for thousands of years .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS People need to know that the mercury in energy saving light bulbs harms people more than the radiation in Fukushima .
__label__WASTE Currently , over 2,000 metric tons of high-level radioactive waste and 12 million cubic feet of low level radioactive waste are produced annually by the 103 operating reactors in the United States .4 No country in the world has found a solution for this waste .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS They pose security , environmental and health risks at every step in their operation .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY nuclear energy has so many more cons than pros because n reality unless you have a good enove cooling system the fision process is very unstable and just measing with uranium-235 can kill you and if that dose not explain it imagine puting a block of c4 in your mouth and ou body is a city then it explodes .
__label__WASTE Radioactive Waste Disposal : As a rule , a nuclear power plant creates 20 metric tons of nuclear fuel per year , and with that comes a lot of nuclear waste .

__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS In fact , a properly functioning nuclear power plant actually releases less radioactivity into the atmosphere than a coal-fired power plant [ source : Hvistendahl ] .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS I have written to several senators and representatives pointing out the need to use nuclear power as the principal sources of power to replace fossil fuels .
__label__OTHER Nuclear energy will serve those priorities well .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY On August 8 , 2005 , President Bush signed an energy bill that included over $ 13 billion in tax breaks and subsidies , as well as other incentives , for the nuclear industry . "
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Since then , it has proven itself as one of our safest energy technologies .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY If the USA would go nuclear it would have to build thousands of nuclear power plants , how can you call that centralized ?
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS However , nuclear power plants are not much of an improvement over conventional coal-burning power plants despite claims that nuclear is the ‘ clean air energy . ’
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Coal and natural gas power plants discharge carbon dioxide into the air , which causes a number of environmental issues .
__label__COSTS Low Operating Costs : Nuclear power produces very inexpensive electricity .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS We can have 100 percent reliable grid across the U.S. without nuclear , without natural gas , without biofuels , with only wind , water , solar , with low-cost storage ,  he said .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The nuclear industry does not need handouts , but a coherent U.S. energy policy should provide a level playing field in the electric markets by recognizing the essential contributions that nuclear power plants make toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions , ensuring reliable electricity and preserving grid stability .
__label__RELIABILITY It is efficient in terms of output versus raw material .
__label__COSTS __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY They are part of a vanguard of next-generation plants that include so-called small modular reactors ( SMRs ) , seen as safer and less costly .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES Both nuclear and renewables are clean , noncarbon electricity generators that should be supported , but the vision that renewables alone can do the job in the next few decades is wishful thinking .
__label__OTHER Nuclear power seeks to harness that energy to safely provide electricity .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY So there ’s enormous excitement and concerted action on nuclear energy — whether it ’s modifying and refining the technology for extant fission reactors by increasing their safety and reliability while lowering their costs or the many worldwide efforts toward achieving nuclear fusion .
__label__RENEWABLES Wind and PV could never reach the zero death requirement that nuclear has to fulfill .
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES Nuclear energy is too expensive , energy efficiency is all that 's needed , with more use of renewables .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS It would finally signal the end of our fossil fuel requirements and at the same time , reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a mere fraction of what they presently are ( 19 ) .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS While we burn fossil fuels , use hydroelectric wind power , harness tidal and solar power , and look for other ways to meet our energy needs - we simply have to use nuclear energy as one method in achieving that .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT In addition , nuclear fission differs from the burning of fossil fuel in that it produces neither sulfur dioxide nor nitrogen oxides , the pollutants that cause acid rain .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS January 8 , 2008 : " There are now dozens of studies , including many by government , engineering consultants , eminent academics and energy industry bodies all showing how this scale of electricity generation could be met through energy efficiency , cleaner use of fossil fuels , renewables and state of the art decentralised power stations like they have in Scandinavia .
__label__RELIABILITY More important , the push by developing countries to increase their standard of living is inexorably tied to a corresponding increase in energy consumption .
__label__RELIABILITY The globe is going to be an increasingly high-energy planet ... and [ emerging markets ] are going to demand the same baseload energy that industrialized countries are used to .
__label__RELIABILITY Nuclear energy makes only a trivial contribution to world energy needs .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS The alternatives to nuclear are coal and natural gas – including unconventional gas resources – and these would be ( over the long-run ) much more polluting and damaging than nuclear .
__label__RENEWABLES There are unlikely to be wars fought over sustainable locally generated , solar , wind or wave power .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT With nuclear power plants , carbon emissions are insignificant .
__label__RELIABILITY It also helps people have more energy to power their homes .
__label__RELIABILITY Nuclear energy distracts governments from taking the real global action necessary to tackle climate change and meet people ’s energy needs . "
__label__COSTS There was talk of a nuclear revival here in the U.S. that really took off in 2003 , after a report from MIT projected a new plant would cost $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion .	NoArgument	train
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Concentration of power in nuclear is economical .
__label__RENEWABLES The one issue that surprises most people is that nuclear power is not renewable .
__label__RELIABILITY Nuclear power can supply a lot more than the 19 % the U.S. electrical supply .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES As solar and wind energy are dependent upon weather conditions , nuclear power plant has no such constraints and can run without disruption in any climatic condition .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ENERGY_POLICY This is one reason why regulators in New York recently adopted a Clean Energy Standard that will provide significant yearly subsidies through 2029 to keep several existing reactors operating .
__label__RELIABILITY The world ’s energy needs are growing .
__label__RENEWABLES The intermittency of renewable energy and unavailability of energy storage means that the installed capacity of renewable sources has to be considerably higher than the desired output ( by a factor of three or more ) .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS The only energy source that can replace FF ’s is nuclear .
__label__OTHER We should use nuclear power because geographically we are dead so no explosions of the nuclear plants .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Still , nuclear energy is produced with a 91 percent rate of efficiency , and without emitting any greenhouse gasses .
__label__RENEWABLES In only a couple of years , all the roofs of new buildings could be covered by solar instead of regular shingles and could be provided with bidirectional meters to guarantee the continuous availability of electricity and the creation of millions of jobs .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES Second , the lifecycle CO2 emissions of nuclear is roughly the same as PV and wind .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ENERGY_POLICY The nuclear industry , she stressed , generates $ 60 billion a year for the U.S. economy and supports 475,000 jobs , all while avoiding emissions that save the United States $ 33 billion annually .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__FOSSIL_FUELS According to a Stanford study , fast breeder reactors ( that convert Uranium into other nuclear fuels while generating energy ) have the potential to generate energy for billions of years , thus they make nuclear energy sustainable while lowering our dependency on oil , thus increasing our energy security .
__label__RENEWABLES Instead , Jacobson proposes that the world overcome its sociopolitical barriers and install 80 percent renewables by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The key is to create safer , cheaper , and smaller nuclear modules for widespread power supply .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Nuclear , especially next-generation nuclear , has tremendous potential to be part of the solution to climate change ,  Hansen said during a panel discussion yesterday .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Good that greenpeace has no influence there to prevent the cleanest and safest energy of all .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT You can not meet Britain ’s future energy needs and reduced carbon emissions without a big expansion of nuclear power .
__label__RENEWABLES Thus , as concerns about climate change have grown , Congress and the states have adopted subsidies and tax credits to expand electricity production from low-carbon and carbon-free renewable fuels in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS It does n't release greenhouse gases , like fossil fuels do , which is great for the environment .
__label__OTHER Well , considering neither proper regulation nor oversight is a reality , I suppose that means nuclear power is not viable .
__label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS __label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT To some , nuclear energy is the savior for our growing energy needs - clean , affordable , limitless , safe and most importantly the major answer to our dwindling supply of fossil fuels ( 1 ) .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Currently nuclear energy saves the emission of 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2 relative to coal .
__label__RENEWABLES Finally , the costs of land-based wind , geothermal and hydroelectricity are competitive with conventional new sources of electricity ; costs of solar and wind over the ocean are higher but declining .
__label__OTHER So nuclear power , which can only generate electricity , is almost irrelevant .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT But I keep hearing them touted as a clean energy source that will do great things for the planet .
__label__WASTE __label__FOSSIL_FUELS July 2005 : " An outstanding advantage of nuclear over fossil fuel energy is how easy it is to deal with the waste it produces .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS If we want to stop using fossil fuels it will likely contain a nuclear component , along with wind and solar .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Even when the entire life cycle is taken into account , however , nuclear energy warms the planet much less than coal or natural gas .
__label__RELIABILITY In fact , quite the opposite — we ’re consuming energy at ever-increasing rates as our technology becomes more sophisticated and our civilization becomes increasingly more dependent on this technology .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Actually , the best form of nuclear power may be Liquid Flouride Thorium Reactors ( LFTR ’s ) which can dramatically lower the risks of nuclear power , and which are much more efficient in using a Thorium/Uranium233 fuel cycle to produce energy ( compared to use of a fuel cycle based on Uranium235/Plutonium , as found in existing nuclear plants ) .
__label__RENEWABLES That being said , nuclear energy is definitely a type of renewable energy that we need to look at .
__label__RELIABILITY Nuclear Energy is the Most Certain Source .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Coal and natural gas power plants emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , which contributes to climate change .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__WASTE It does not emit greenhouse gases and the waste can be disposed of easily .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS This makes nuclear energy , as a clean alternative to coal , unnecessary .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION A number of nuclear energy innovations have made it a much more feasible choice than others .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Finally , and most importantly to the stringent Clean Air Acts and their equivalents in the countries actively looking to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions , nuclear power represents the power source with the lowest pollution levels .
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS If we reduced safety standards to those applied to wind and PV , a nuclear power plant could easily be build in the same time needed to build a conventional coal or gas plant .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION On the other hand , by using breeder and fusion reactors , we can produce other fissionable element .
__label__OTHER Nuclear power is one component of this system .
__label__RENEWABLES They all ( most ) show how there is big money in Renewables .
__label__COSTS Costs of nuclear have historically been underestimated .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES Also , unlike wind and solar power , nuclear power can provide a continuous flow of energy that utilities can depend on any time of day .
__label__OTHER The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) approved construction of four new reactors in 2012 , which are expected to go online in 2020 .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear energy is one of the most viable alternatives to oil , particularly because it is capable of supplying such massive amounts of energy .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS April 16th , 2006 : " Wind and solar power have their place , but because they are intermittent and unpredictable they simply ca n't replace big baseload plants such as coal , nuclear and hydroelectric .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It does not release green house gases or use fossil fuels .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS In fact , we could be producing 100 % of our energy from renewables by 2050 , and the technology is already ready for market – particularly if the subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear are cut .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Ultimately , we are looking to renewable energy and nuclear power is not renewable - the fuel will run out eventually , just like gas and oil .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Firstly , nuclear energy does not produce green house gas and that means that our atmosphere will be safe and more efficient .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It does n't release greenhouse gases which would help us stop global warming .
__label__RELIABILITY The World Economic Council , for instance , predicts that world energy consumption will increase from 546 exajoules ( EJ — 1018 joules ) ( 2010 levels ) to anywhere from 700 to 900 EJ by 2050 , depending on the level of world economic cooperation and concerted action in the future .
__label__COSTS __label__FOSSIL_FUELS In 2004 , the average cost of producing nuclear energy in the United States was less than two cents per kilowatt-hour , comparable with coal and hydroelectric .
__label__RENEWABLES And even if the US builds 1/4 of the renewables needed to achieve his dream , the rebates , taxes your local taxes , the cost of electricity is going to bankrupt the USA .
__label__RENEWABLES Yes , Mr. Doron is right that our aging nuclear plants have to be shut down , but he is wrong to suggest that we can afford to build new ones or that solar energy is not ready to take over .
__label__OTHER But what is good and reaffirming , is that we are now finally entering the nuclear age .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION The latest generation of nuclear reactors have improved capacities and generating capabilities , but with comparable emissions .
__label__OTHER Greater use of nuclear power is central to their recommendations .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Firstly it would use up green house gas and would make more pollution in the world .
__label__COSTS [ And , why would nuclear energy be expanding internationally if it was n't inherently economical ? ]
__label__RENEWABLES Even the much heralded solar energy has the potential to be incorporated into these structures if it develops in certain ways .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT According to this twisted logic , environmental benefits from new nuclear power plants do receive proper credit under the Obama administration ’s Clean Power Plan .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS They could entirely replace the world 's fossil fuel-based energy system by 2050 , if governments will it to be so , he said .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY And the next generation of nuclear reactors will be even cheaper , safer , and more environmentally benign .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION It 's an exciting notion to me that we have zero carbon emission from nuclear and the new ... electrical generation facilities are a one refuel for fifty years of life .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY These fears are unjustified and nuclear energy from its start in 1952 has proved to be the safest of all energy sources . "
__label__OTHER Waste heat from nuclear reactors can be used " How nuclear power could fertilise fields . "
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ENERGY_POLICY [ ... ] On 18 September , the DOE announced that its Next Generation Nuclear Plant project will receive a $ 40 million boost in funding .
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES The construction of a nuclear power plant requires much less investment than a hydroelectric one .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES __label__WASTE __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Unlike coal and oil , these renewable forms of energy are freely available , do n’t pollute the environment with waste ( radioactive or otherwise ) , do n’t need to be fought over , do n’t contribute to global warming , and do n’t require massive amounts of farmland , energy , and water as do biofuels .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Last week , more than 200 United Nations researchers threw their weight behind atomic energy , calling for a tripling of output within the coming years as a means to combat carbon emissions .
__label__RENEWABLES If the money pumped into nuclear had been spent on renewables , then the pay-off would have been much greater per-euro invested .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Commercial nuclear energy is already the cheapest , safest and environmentally benign carbon neutral source of energy on Earth .
__label__RENEWABLES Enough wind and solar exist in high-wind and sunny locations over land to power the world for all purposes multiple times over .
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES Wind farms take only 18 months to come online ; nuclear plants typically take in excess of 10 years .
__label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The move comes against the backdrop of nuclear innovations that seek to address safety and cost issues that have hampered the sector .
__label__OTHER Carbon emissions are among the chief cause of global climate change , according to the Environmental Protection Agency and a broad consensus of climate scientists .
__label__RELIABILITY It is the most efficient use of the Earth 's resources .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It also does n't have green house gases .
__label__OTHER If Europe really wants a nuclear-free world , then it has to commit to abandoning nuclear technology completely .
__label__RELIABILITY : Nuclear energy is not renewable resource .
__label__RENEWABLES Instead , it should feature conservation , more efficient products , and safe renewable forms of energy such as wind , solar , and geothermal power to protect public health . ”
__label__OTHER A typical nuclear power plant generates about 1,000 megawatts with capacity factors over 90 percent .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Halt any investment in fossil fuel infrastructure , including natural gas , and phase out all fossil fuel power plants .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT And that even though Hydro and biomass energy destroys the most nature of all .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT September 12 , 2007 : " Here 's the reality : The U.S. needs more energy , and we need to get it without further harming our environment .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The last to close , in 2013 , ran with much reduced emissions , well under 1 % of total US CFC emissions .
__label__OTHER It costs as much as a nuclear power plant and makes 1/10 of the usable power ( allowing for capacity factor ) .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENERGY_POLICY The main argument for not including existing nuclear power plants – as well as electricity from large hydropower dams – in clean air mandates and subsidies is that contributions from these conventional sources would dwarf new renewable generation , which the federal government wishes to encourage .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS End all subsidies for fossil fuels and impose a greenhouse gas fee / tax to charge polluters for the damage they have created . "
__label__RENEWABLES Similarly , wind power generates no waste and can sustain our planet for millenia to come .
__label__RENEWABLES In contrast , measures such as bicycle transport , passive solar design , solar heating , wind power or biogas production lend themselves to local community control .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Energy inputs to nuclear fuel cycle produce only a few ( eg 1-3 ) percent of the CO2 emissions saved .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT “ Nuclear power is not a near-term solution to the challenge of climate change , ” writes Sharon Squassoni in the IAEA bulletin .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Even if it will run out in the future and is not " renewable " , is it still worth pursuing now ( particularly in the face of global warming ) ?
__label__RENEWABLES Nuclear power will be like the sun at the center of the “ energy solar system , ” orbited by satellite technologies like wind and solar — which will support and complement it — but overwhelming every alternative by dint of its sheer gravitational ( or energetic , as the case may be ) influence .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Without batteries to store renewable energy over a span of months and not just days , the United States is not likely to achieve 100 percent renewable power in this century and will have to rely on either fossil fuels with carbon capture or nuclear power , Chu said , concluding that " although nuclear power has a lot of bad things , it is carbon-free . "
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__WASTE On the other hand , unlike costly and dangerous nuclear power , renewables are meeting energy needs quickly and without the problem of a deadly waste legacy or risking the diversion of radioactive materials .
__label__RENEWABLES Furthermore , if we do n’t start using renewable now then we may never make the switch , so this is the chance to take that first step .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT This will help countries reach those targets and move towards a cleaner and more efficient energy future ( 10 ) .
__label__RENEWABLES Solar can lower demand spikes by producing the most power on the days when the most power is used ( hot , sunny days when people run the AC ) .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Replacing coal to limit global warming should not be based on another toxic product .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Not only will nuclear power not fully relieve the need for fossil fuels , it wo n’t relieve it AT ALL for very long .
__label__COSTS Nuclear power is relatively inexpensive Patrick Moore .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear power plants do not produce greenhouse gases as do those powered by coal or natural gas .
__label__OTHER The only legitimate concern that nuclear retirements are premature is that electricity markets do not fully account for the external ' social cost ' of pollution ,  wrote Devin Hartman , a senior fellow at the institute .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The nuclear phase-out is as much part of the Energiewende ( energy transition ) as the move towards a low-carbon economy .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY As world leaders , you can work together to replace this small amount of energy from other readily available , very safe and affordable sources of energy to move us towards a carbon-free and nuclear-free future . ”
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES __label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Despite more than $ 150 billion in federal subsides over the past 60 years ( roughly 30 times more than solar , wind and other renewable energy sources have received ) , nuclear power still costs substantially more than electricity made from wind , coal , oil or natural gas .
__label__COSTS Portability and Productivity • Because nuclear power produces an enormous amount of energy using a very small amount of fuel , its average production cost is just 1.87 cents per kilowatt hour .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS It is a clean source of energy and would be cost effective .
__label__RENEWABLES Renewable energy sources should be used instead .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES In other words , we have to build more than we need , and other energy sources are needed to provide backup when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT But nuclear energy is n't really a zero-carbon system , since you still have to manufacture power plants , mine and enrich uranium , and transport processed fuelâ € ” all of which typically rely on CO2-emitting fuel sources .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES Nuclear power plants require much less land area than comparable output wind or solar power sites .

__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS __label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS The best reason to use more nuclear power , and the reason it is proving so popular with 21st century governments keen to save money and reduce reliance on oil ( 14 ) - particularly from countries that have seen political instability in the last few years - is the very low greenhouse gas emissions ( 7 ) .

__label__RENEWABLES Both wind and solar can each be scaled to meet the energy needs of the entire globe and OTEC as well as geothermal and osmotic power have the same potential .
__label__OTHER The figures are not supported by evidence , and a typical energy input for nuclear power amounts to about 2-3 % of output , and even if this were all fossil fuel sourced , the impact is trivial .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Climate change was a key focus for the nuclear industry under the Obama administration , including treatment under U.S. EPA 's Clean Power Plan and ongoing studies at DOE on how plant closures would affect U.S. greenhouse gas emissions .
__label__RENEWABLES The stuff could be spent on nuclear energy instead of renewable energy !
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS The efficiency of the wind and solar power plants are getting higher every year and could potentially be used to relieve our need for fossil fuels , at least more than nuclear power could .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES Studies have shown that what life-cycle emissions that the plants do give off are on par with renewable energy sources such as wind power .
__label__RENEWABLES What about all the CO2 emissions created by the manufacturing and assembling of wind farms or solar energy installations ?
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__WASTE Former Energy Secretary Steven Chu during a keynote address at an American Bar Association forum in California last week cast nuclear power as critical to curbing greenhouse gas emissions despite challenges surrounding spent fuel .
__label__OTHER Background : During the 1960 's and 1970 's nuclear energy was once touted as " the " best way to produce electricity .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Renewables may be used as much as possible , but intrinsic limitations ( diffuse , intermittent sources ) mean that wind and sun can never economically replace sources such as coal , gas and nuclear for large-scale , continuous , reliable supply .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear plants only produce electricity and ca n't replace oil and gas " The case against nuclear power " .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__PUBLIC_DEBATE But at least a few voices within the movement insist that soaring global demand for energy makes it imperative for climate change advocates to fully embrace atomic power .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Any investment put in nuclear is investment taken away from renewable energy , the proven climate change solution .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES __label__ENERGY_POLICY Nuclear is a centralized power source requiring large infrastructure , investment , and coordination where decentralized sources ( including solar and wind ) can be more efficient , less costly , and more resilient .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS __label__ENERGY_POLICY Fossil fuels receive large direct and indirect subsidies , such as tax benefits and not having to pay for the greenhouse gases they emit .
__label__RELIABILITY This means for every kilowatt of electricity produced , almost twice as much waste heat is generated .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES I strongly disagree that wind and solar have a higher chance at being able to meet our needs over nuclear energy .
__label__RENEWABLES After considering the best available technologies , we decided that a combination of wind , concentrated solar , geothermal , photovoltaics , tidal , wave and hydroelectric energy could more than meet all the planet 's energy needs , particularly if all the world 's vehicles could be run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Fossil fuel burning produces twenty seven thousand million tons of carbon dioxide yearly .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES From a facility " footprint " standpoint , less space is required for a nuclear electric generating facility than for a comparable-capacity wind or solar plant .
__label__OTHER Nuclear energy economies of scale are improving Pascal Zachary .
__label__RENEWABLES With subsidies , wind power is practically free in some markets .
__label__COSTS If external costs are accounted , nuclear is very competitive .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE Nuclear power is once again considered a prominent alternative , despite the disregard it was met with in the 1970s .
__label__OTHER The industry does not pay the total costs of all research into nuclear energy .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear energy is the primary alternative to dirty coal Patrick Moore .
__label__COSTS __label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It is , and it is not only safe , clean and inexhaustible , but also a fuel that is free .
__label__COSTS Hence , from an economic and environmental perspective , nuclear power makes no sense ; numerous studies from the Wall Street Journal and independent energy analysts have put the cost of nuclear power at between 12-20 cents per kilowatt-hour ( kWh ) .
__label__OTHER Nuclear power is not a solution .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__COSTS __label__FOSSIL_FUELS There are cleaner , safer and cheaper alternatives available that can produce our electricity without using nuclear or fossil fuels .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The nuclear industry would like us to believe that nuclear power offers a much better option for generating electricity without releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gases or toxic pollution .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__RELIABILITY Centralized nuclear energy production is inefficient .
__label__RENEWABLES Solar power is more renewable and cleaner .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT [ It ] will have a real and tangible benefits in terms of improving the odds of a better climate outcome , reducing the chance of extreme outcomes , improving our changes of limiting the warming to the lowest levels we can ,  he said .
__label__OTHER How many electric vehicles could be powered by 50 or 100 more nuclear power plants ?
__label__RENEWABLES Other renewable power sources such as solar and hydroelectric , can not provide the large scale power generation which is needed .
__label__RENEWABLES Mark Jacobson , a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University , is optimistic that the world can meet the 2 C target and , in fact , stabilize emissions at 350 ppm instead of the 450 ppm that the United Nations aspires to , using solely renewable energy .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It does not make greenhouse gases so it is a good switch over .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Given that hydroelectric resources are built pretty much to capacity , nuclear is , by elimination , the only viable substitute for coal .
__label__COSTS __label__FOSSIL_FUELS There are sure monetary focal points in setting up nuclear power plants and utilizing nuclear energy in lieu of traditional energy .
__label__OTHER An ACTU policy against uranium mining is not enough : it does not in itself challenge any of the driving forces behind nuclear power .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Small modular reactor ( SMR ) that have about a third of the output of typical nuclear reactors could be the key to making nuclear power the energy source of the future .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS In the EU and in North America largely due to instability of fossil fuel availability , that the world may have reached peak oil , high prices and a need to increase power production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions ( 4 ) ( and also that older plants need to be updated ) , means we are once again faced with the possibility of a nuclear future .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The sober warning is that if more is not done , nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material contribution to climate change risk mitigation .
__label__RENEWABLES [ ... ] Renewable energy , on the other hand , is the cleanest , safest and most reliable form of power generation . "
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Without an increase in the rate of new-plant construction that surpasses that of the global construction programs of the 1970s and 1980s , nuclear power can not make a meaningful contribution to climate change risk mitigation .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Doing this we help slow down global warming .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Hydro and liquefied gas are the greatest killers , even before coal , but do environmentalists care ?
__label__RENEWABLES Subsidies and investment could be spent on other solutions ( such as renewable energy systems ) .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Low Pollution : Nuclear power also has a lot fewer greenhouse emissions .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It is the only nonpolluting energy source that can provide the steady base needs of the power grid into the future .
__label__RENEWABLES In contradistinction , contemporary renewables , or future developments thereof , can be deployed progressively and give a fast return on investment capital .
__label__OTHER We need all the electricity sources we can get .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The emissions of green house gases and therefore the contribution of nuclear power plants to global warming is therefore relatively little .
__label__COSTS [ Counter :] It is in fact one of the least expensive energy sources .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES In sum , if we invest in nuclear versus true renewables , you can bet that the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting while we wait , and wait , for the nuclear age to arrive .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear power requires a very small area .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ENERGY_POLICY If the government supports nuclear energy ( a well established and easily scalable industry ) , newer and less mature renewable energy start-ups will have difficulty growing .

__label__OTHER So for us to say we wo n't use all the tools [ such as nuclear energy ] to solve the problem is crazy . "
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES Nuclear is much cheaper than wind or PV and for wind and solar greens always argue , yes the costs high , but we have to bear them for the sake of the environment .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES Geothermal energy also has a much smaller footprint than nuclear ; solar only slightly more .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear energy has a smaller surface-area footprint on the land .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Even if we doubled nuclear power in the UK it would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Like coal or oil , it was a way of producing electricity at a central location for distribution through the established grid .
__label__OTHER Other states should consider taking similar steps to recognize the benefits of nuclear power and prevent premature plant closures .
__label__RENEWABLES Nuclear power already delivers less energy globally than renewable energy , and the share will continue to decrease in the coming years .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY If the United States is to be a major player in the world ’s energy future , we must advance our nuclear power programs as quickly as possible .
__label__OTHER Each additional contribution and each additional increase in ambition that countries make under the Paris framework will help improve our chances of limiting future warming .
__label__OTHER To do this we need to … make a dramatic and rapid retreat from the use of nuclear power to generate electricity .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES Since most forms of renewable energy do n’t fill the bill , “ nuclear fission today represents the only present-day zero-carbon technology with the demonstrated ability to meet most , if not all , of the energy demands of a modern economy . ”
__label__ENERGY_POLICY The Bush administration gave the nuclear industry $ 18.5 billion in loan guarantees to try to encourage investment in new nuclear plants .
__label__OTHER All in all I would say that the future of nuclear power looks promising .
__label__OTHER But the plan includes no economic rewards for keeping existing efficient , well-run plants in operation .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS His figures show that nuclear energy is the only source that can challenge the climate-changing and environment-destroying fossil fuels for supremacy in providing the world ’s energy needs .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS It can produce all the electricity that is needed and all the liquid fuels that are needed or wanted and produce them cleanly and cheaply .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS With the concern about climate change and the increased cost of fossil fuels , there has been an increase interest in using nuclear energy to produce electricity .
__label__OTHER The economics are just not there .
__label__OTHER For nuclear to meet all the world 's energy needs today -- 12.5 terawatts ( 1 terawatt = 1 trillion watts ) -- more than 17,000 nuclear plants would be needed .
__label__OTHER Opponents argue the country is n't ready for an end to nuclear power .
__label__RENEWABLES The advantages of renewables are a given .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT [ W ] e can now move forward to preserve and enhance our air , aquatic , and terrestrial environments . . . to carry out the policies and goals set forth in the bill to provide each citizen of this great country a healthful environment .
__label__RENEWABLES Geothermal energy is also usable as a reasonably permanent renewable resource .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS This is because it ’s now being touted as a more environmentally beneficial solution since it emits far fewer greenhouse gases during electricity generation than coal or other traditional power plants .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear energy is a practical solution to many of the problems posed by fossil fuels but of course it will not completely replace fossil fuels .
__label__RELIABILITY Energy efficiency is more important than nuclear power .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION There are technological innovations in the wings at the moment that will make it much quicker to build nuclear power stations ,  he said .
__label__COSTS Construction cost overruns notwithstanding , most nuclear power plants produce electricity at competitive costs .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Yet , rising concerns regarding global warming and energy prices , however , nuclear energy has seen renewed attention as alternative form of energy .
__label__RELIABILITY • It leads to relative large amount of energy that produced per land area .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Fossil fuels , not nuclear , are the real enemies of renewables .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It ’s a valuable area of research that could guarantee abundant clean energy , so it ’s worth investing in the technology , continuing to use it and not abandoning it .
__label__OTHER If nations meet their Paris pledges , called intended nationally determined contributions , or INDCs , and continue decarbonizing beyond 2030 at a rate of 5 percent , there is more than a 3-in-4 chance that a 4 C temperature rise could be avoided .
__label__OTHER Certainly orders of magnitude larger than the corrupting ability of green power , in terms of dollars .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES Being modular and decentralized by nature , new renewable energy can be expanded and built much more rapidly ( and operated more efficiently given the country 's archipelagic character ) than nuclear and conventional polluting sources .
__label__RENEWABLES As a result , the percentage of electricity from renewables has significantly increased in recent years , which is great .
__label__COSTS __label__WASTE __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Economic • Net external Costs are much cheaper then other forms of production • As of 2005 Nuclear power was : – 3/4 the cost of coal – 1/5 the cost of gas • Nuclear energy is , in many places , competitive with fossil fuels for electricity generation , despite relatively high capital costs and the need to internalize all waste disposal and decommissioning costs .
__label__RENEWABLES Scientific studies too numerous to mention show repeatedly that wind , solar , geothermal , and tidal sources of clean energy are abundant and easily accessible .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS It does n't depend on fossil fuels and is n't affected by fluctuating oil and gas prices .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT To the editor : Bryce wants us to build new nuclear power plants as a partial solution to global warming .
__label__OTHER The world energy demand is projected to grow by 50 % by 2030 .
__label__OTHER Nuclear Power Is the Future  .

__label__OTHER also kids would be homeless and what would we do if we ran out of nuclear power ?
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Palo Alto , California ( CNN ) -- If our nation wants to reduce global warming , air pollution and energy instability , we should invest only in the best energy options .

__label__COSTS __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Wigley of the University of Adelaide sees improvements on the horizon for nuclear technologies , particularly in China , where modifications of Westinghouse technology could allow new plants to be set up in two to three years .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS In so far as fossil fuels contribute to global warming and nuclear energy does not , therefore , fossil fuels are the real enemy of renewables .
__label__OTHER There is no need for nuclear .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION The Department of Energy ( DOE ) is expanding its development of nuclear reactors that churn out large amounts of waste heat , which could be used in a number of other industries .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Firstly , it does n't let out green house gases that destroy the environment .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Maria Korsnick , the new head of the Nuclear Energy Institute , told skeptical Wall Street analysts in New York today that supporting financially struggling , aging reactors is critical to curbing heat-trapping emissions , and that states like Illinois , New York and now Connecticut are stepping up with financial support ( Energywire , Feb. 9 ) .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES Finally , nuclear power can provide a reliable , steady stream of electricity that 's not dependent on a shining sun or blowing winds , giving it an advantageâ € ” in some people 's minds â € ” over its renewable competitors .
__label__OTHER Although it is not expected to be ready for 50-100 years it holds the most promise for nuclear energy .
__label__OTHER Whether we like it or not , nuclear power benefits us all .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT My reasons are Firstly It will not use green house gasses and will save the world from pollution .
__label__RELIABILITY Furthermore , we have the technology to tap into them to provide not just the 20 percent of electricity currently provided by nuclear in the United States , but to provide all of our electrical needs .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear power provides other benefits in addition to clean air .
__label__RELIABILITY Nuclear power can not replace that energy .
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES Wind power typically costs much more than nuclear - often twice as much per kWh , and can not provide power on demand .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It has been determined that the amount of greenhouse gases have decreased by almost half because of the prevalence in the utilization of nuclear power .
__label__RENEWABLES By investing so much money into building power plants , efforts to build sustainable energy supplies are deterred .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__WASTE Solar , wind , geothermal , hydro and other forms of green power are cheaper , cleaner , safer , faster to build , require no federal limits on liability and create no radioactive waste .
__label__RENEWABLES So from a CO2 perspective , exactly how is the building of a nuclear plant all that different from the building of any number of renewable energy plants – or any other modern structure for that matter ?
__label__OTHER Nuclear is the best way to generate electricity .
__label__COSTS Also , even though the expense of setting up nuclear power plants is moderately high , the expense of running them is quite low low .
__label__RENEWABLES Wind farms can be up and running in less than a year .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear power plants can not be brought on line fast enough to prevent the rapid climate change disaster coming in less than 10 years ( See Shootout : Do We Need To Restrict CO2 Emissions ? )
__label__OTHER Remember : Nuclear energy is n’t the solution to humanity ’s problems — it ’s the source .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ENERGY_POLICY He wants Congress to pay for testing new designs for nuclear plants and tells us that “ nuclear energy 's importance in reducing emissions is beyond dispute . ”
__label__RENEWABLES In addition , nuclear power takes up much less real estate to generate the same amount of power that wind or solar would .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES When we compare it to very clean and renewable sources such as solar , the footprint of the complex is much smaller for the same output of voltaic panels and far smaller than that required for wind turbines , so it takes up much less space .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In November 2000 the world recognised nuclear power as a dirty , dangerous and unnecessary technology by refusing to give it greenhouse gas credits during the UN Climate Change talks in The Hague .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES In fact , to equal the electrical output of a single 3.000 megawatt-electric nuclear generating station , it would take roughly 2.000 wind turbines or 140 square kilometres of solar panels .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT This enormous demand for new generating capacity must be met while also containing global warming and minimizing pollution and other environmental damage .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS And nuclear energy has lower greenhouse gas emissions than other power sources , especially coal , so it is considered a clean provider of electricity .
__label__RENEWABLES Furthermore , it is feasible to get private insurance for renewables , whereas the private sector is unwilling to underwrite nuclear facilities , whether LFTR or otherwise .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES Large power-generating capacity able to meet industrial and city needs ( as opposed to low-power technologies like solar that might meet only local , residential , or office needs but can not generate power for heavy manufacturing ) .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Modern power stations generate more energy and are safer than their older counterparts .
__label__RENEWABLES Nuclear energy undermines renewable solutions to climate change " The case against nuclear power " .
__label__COSTS The fuel itself is relatively inexpensive , at least for the time being .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Should this prevent the further development of nuclear energy , particularly if it is believed that nuclear energy is part of the solution to the global warming crisis ?
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS If abundance of cheap energy is available then that changes the landscape , we no longer need to insure future oil and coal supply , so no need to tear up other countries and pursuing these ends .
__label__RENEWABLES The right-leaning R Street Institute released a report this week that found no economic justification for financially supporting reactors that have been disadvantaged by cheap natural gas , state clean energy programs and federal tax incentives for wind .
__label__RENEWABLES Nuclear energy will compete with and squeeze out renewable energy .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Pros Nuclear power can generate a vast amount of energy without spewing out air pollution during operation .
__label__RELIABILITY But whether we like it or not , fission nuclear energy will remain an integral part of the global energy budget — there ’s just nothing else capable of supplying the kind of power our civilization needs ( at least , among proven and implemented technologies ) .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear power is far from emission-free on a lifecycle basis , and the energy inputs from fossil fuels negate any advantage from reduced direct emissions of CO2 .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Fall , 2006 - " Roughly 700 million metric tons of CO2 emissions are avoided each year in the United States by generating electricity from nuclear power rather than some other source .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT So scientists have now turned their attention to what would be needed after 2030 to meet a 2 C goal : an energy system transformation that emits less carbon .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It produces no harmful greenhouse gases , isolates its waste from the environment , and requires less area to produce the same amount of electricity as other sources .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Finally , perhaps most importantly , PV & wind are unreliable and require fossil fuel ( typically natural gas ) backup for the most of the time the wind is n’t blowing & the sun is n’t shining .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS However , natural gas is still a carbon-emitting technology and contributes to climate change .
__label__COSTS Energy conservation is seven times more cost-effective than nuclear power .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear energy has the least effect on nature since it does n’t discharge any gasses like methane and carbon dioxide , which are the primary “ greenhouse gasses . ”
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY February 5 , 2006 : " In recent years , several electric utilities have emerged as nuclear-power specialists , reaping economies of scale and building expertise that enables them to run safer , more secure operations .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Wind and solar are currently wholly dependent on natural gas and perpetuate the very fossil fuel energy sources that they are intended to replace .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION With new generations of reactors , potential major breakthroughs such as nuclear fusion , the methods we use to harness nuclear energy will get better in the next coming years .
__label__RENEWABLES It remains up to nuclear and renewable energies to fill the gap .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Improved building insulation and super efficient light bulbs and clothes dryers are more cost effective ways of cutting down on energy use and setting back global warming .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS To meet the short-term demand , the use of coal and other fossil fuels will increase .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Enthusiasts say that the third generation nuclear stations are cleaner and safer than their older counterparts and provide more energy and this , along with the need to reduce emissions , is driving nuclear power policy .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Though dwindling fossil fuels were not an issue in the 1950 's when the first commercial nuclear power stations opened ( 2 ) around the world , it was clear there was a potential for efficient generation of cleaner power that could easily accommodate the growing demands of the future .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT With nuclear power plants , CO2 emissions are minimal .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS The report ’s concluding statement is highly significant for those environmentalists who have been taken in by the pro-nuclear argument that “ at least it ’s not coal . ”
__label__OTHER It is safer , cleaner with very little radiation because of how the energy is produced and processed .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS More Proficient Than Fossil Fuels : The other primary point of interest of utilizing nuclear energy is that it is more compelling and more proficient than other energy sources .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It does n't use fossil fuels and does n't release greenhouse gasses and that means it 's better for the environment .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY We need a safe , genuinely sustainable , global and green solution to our energy needs , not a dangerous diversion like nuclear power .
__label__COSTS “ The need to immediately and dramatically reduce carbon emissions calls for approaches that can be implemented more quickly than building nuclear reactors . ”
__label__RENEWABLES The world can be powered by wind , water and sun alone .
__label__OTHER Hidehiko Nishiyama , deputy director general of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency , Japan ’s nuclear regulator , admitted on March 29 that , “ We will have to continue cooling for quite a long period .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES Nuclear power plants can adjust their output as needed verses the intermittent wind or solar generated electric power .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It 's not that we 're anti-nuclear , but that nuclear is not the best way to advance carbon control given its economic situation ,  Thomas Cochran , former director of the Natural Resources Defense Council 's nuclear program , said in an interview .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear energy is highly efficient The efficient use of natural resources is a major criteria in determining the environmental friendliness of a source of energy .
__label__RENEWABLES The country now seems on track to fill the gap with renewable energy .
__label__RENEWABLES By contrast , wars fought over locally generated solar , wind and wave power are unlikely to occur .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__PUBLIC_DEBATE Voters have decided against a timetable that would see Switzerland stop using nuclear power by 2029 .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The following nuclear power plants have been shut down due to being unsafe or past their operating life in the US : Big Rock Point , Bonus , Dresdent-1 , Elk Rivers , Enrico Fermi-1 , Frt St. Vrain , GE Vallecitos , Haddam Neck , Hallam , Humboldt Bay , Indian Point-1 , Lacrosse , Maine Yankee , Millstone-1 , Pathfinder , Peach Bottom-1 , Piqua , and many others .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS If these plants are shuttered , their output will be replaced in many cases by natural gas generation , which will increase greenhouse gas emissions , as has occurred after recent nuclear plant closures in Vermont and Wisconsin .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT These abandoned reactors are taking up valuable land space , could be contaminating the areas surrounding them , yet are often too unstable to be removed .
__label__COSTS Swiss utility BKW AG already plans to shutter Muehleberg in 2019 , citing the high costs of maintenance and operations .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY They have been recognized to have serious design faults since the 1970s and have been regularly retrofitted ( i.e. , patched up ) to take into account new research illustrating their design vulnerabilities to such things as power outages and other malfunctions that make possible a core breach and a resulting release of radioactive isotopes .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY A PRA must be done separately for each power plant ( at a cost of $ 5 million ) but we give typical results here : A fuel melt-down might be expected once in 20,000 years of reactor operation .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Fukushima was an old plant , and the latest generation of nuclear reactor designs are much less likely to meltdown .
__label__RENEWABLES Switzerland has a 2050 energy strategy in which it would gradually replace nuclear power that now supplies about a third of the country ’s electricity with renewables , including wind and solar .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Germany plans to shutter its remaining nuclear plants by 2022 , a response to the 2011 disaster in Japan that also prompted the Swiss initiative .
__label__OTHER German media reported in May 2014 that the three big utility firms themselves suggested transferring all assets from retired nuclear power stations , including waste and reserves , into a bad bank .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Swiss Green Party advocates for a quicker atomic power exit have cited worries about an aging atomic capability , with Beznau I the oldest operating nuclear power station in the world , having been started in 1969 .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__ENERGY_POLICY Japan turned off its 50 nuclear power reactors in the wake of Fukushima , but the government decided in 2014 to start operating reactors again after a security check .
__label__COSTS This on-off tendency made it more difficult and costly for utilities to gain the expertise in nuclear power or to run plants properly . "
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY NuScale ’s concept reactors would use a safer , self-contained design with fewer moving parts than standard nuclear plants — for instance , it uses natural convection for reactor cooling , obviating the kind of coolant pump damage that doomed Fukushima .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY If you ’ve ever researched the safety features that are included in a reactor , you would know how low the probability is .
__label__COSTS __label__RENEWABLES As nuclear plants have to be run continuously as close to full capacity as possible to even come close to justifying their enormous construction , operating , and decommissioning costs , they compete not just for funding , but they compete directly with clean renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar , which are similarly best operated on a continual basis .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Nuclear power plants are generally operated better than they were 20 or 30 years ago , but you can never rule out the possibility , however remote , of a very serious accident ,  Nogee said .
__label__COSTS Some of the lifetime use will be lower than other kinds of reactors but for example replacing the container every seven years is not too expensive and solves the problem .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS In pure numbers , there have been more coal power accidents than nuclear .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Many nuclear power plants exist today , and are being upgraded .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Despite ongoing quarrels over its costs and an international perception that “ German angst ” caused the government to shut down reactors after the Fukushima accident , a vast majority of Germans is still in favour of putting an end to nuclear power .
__label__RELIABILITY But worldwide , nuclear plants are down 15 percent of the time , and when a plant goes down , so does a large fraction of the grid .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT When they are not maintained , have structural flaws or were improperly installed , a nuclear reactor could release harmful amounts of radiation into the environment during the process of regular use .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Modern nuclear plant designs therefore incorporate greatly enhanced safety features that , for example , allow a reactor to shut down and cool itself by natural forces like gravity and natural circulation , without external electrical power .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENERGY_POLICY Alongside that , the highly centralized nature of nuclear plants means that if one or more goes down , at one stroke it takes out an enormous chunk of the electricity supply grid .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The main institutional opponents of the measure were the government and energy companies , which had threatened that a " Yes " vote would lead to blackouts , higher costs and a reliance on dirty coal power from Germany , which plans to close all nuclear plants by 2022 in response to the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan - which was also the impetus for Switzerland 's referendum .
__label__RELIABILITY Just to maintain the current world production of nuclear power , either the oldest , creakiest plants need to be relicensed or a veritable orgy of nuclear construction needs to begin .
__label__COSTS With a portion of the initial nuclear power plants closing or requiring significant upgrade after just a few decades ( in some cases less than sixty years ) , it seems that the life cycle of some plants is much shorter than perhaps the outward cost might warrant ( 14 ) .
__label__COSTS New types of reactors have a very expensive licensing process that arguably needs to change but that plus the fact that it is a drastic design change that would require new skills and new training for plant workers .
__label__COSTS This causes utilities to operate nuclear power plants in an up and down mode rather than their normal baseload operation , making them even less competitive .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The number of U.S. reactors shut down for a year or longer to address numerous safety problems provides strong evidence of poor safety practices and inadequate NRC enforcement .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Nuclear plants are being closed due to safety ; this should continue .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear power stations are set up in a multiple-step process that has been designed to help contain the energy and many of its negative byproducts .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In 2007 , the nuclear industry generated more electricity than ever before , and we did it more safely than ever before as evidenced by data on unplanned reactor shutdowns and the industrial safety rate .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Some Soviet designed and built reactors have been a safety concern for many years , but are much better now than in 1986 .
__label__OTHER The deuterium electrolysis isnt normally used due to the high power use , not a problem for a reactor station .
__label__OTHER With each closure of an operating U.S. nuclear power plant , the infrastructure built over the past 50 years – including suppliers , vendors , operators , maintenance and manpower – becomes increasingly imperiled as it serves a dwindling number of plants .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Fusion , of course , is the ultimate dream : virtually unlimited , radiation-free clean energy powered by the most abundant element in the universe and with no carbon emissions .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Nuclear fusion is a reality , we have observed it in the universe yet building a reactor capable of producing and containing it is still decades away - some say it will not arrive until the middle of this century at the very earliest ( 17 , p7-8 ) .
__label__RELIABILITY Fusion offers the potential for basically an inexhaustible source of energy .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS The FFI also knows that NE can easily replace all the energy produced by coal , oil , and gas .
__label__OTHER This technology is readily available , it does not have to be developed first .
__label__RELIABILITY We see this in stars ( 17 , p1 ) at present and the possibility of a limitless almost cost-free fuel supply is a veritable holy grail for our existing and growing power needs .
__label__RELIABILITY Also , if we know how to control atomic fusion , the same reactions that fuel the sun , we can have almost unlimited energy .
__label__OTHER I ’ll bet this functionality will be beneficial even at several times background radiation .
__label__RELIABILITY Besides , it can be built anywhere , provided that there is water around to cool the reactors .
__label__COSTS I have heard rumors that $ 1B would be enough to have a production like facility that would be able to produce modular systems in approx 10 years .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT So if nuclear power can play a role in cooling our planet , the Lantern thinks it deserves to stay on the table .
__label__RENEWABLES The sun shines only part of the time in much of the world , but nuclear energy is beneficial for various military and civilian applications .
__label__OTHER Modern reactors are being built overseas in many countries .
__label__WEAPONS Since the development of the atomic bomb , the human race has found other uses for this technology that still divides people - it provides power for our homes and has medicinal uses .
__label__COSTS So the reactor may be cheap , but we just do n’t know how much the reprocessing will cost .
__label__OTHER On the other hand , if reprocessing really works as well this may be a major proliferation concern – not only getting Pa233 but also Pu239 from a reactor running on normal LEU .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS If SA could find a place away from human cities and towns that could be used for a nuclear power plant , I think it could work .
__label__COSTS A standard plant could cost as little as $ 2 billion , she said , a fraction of the cost of a uranium-based plant .
__label__RELIABILITY Depending on reactor design , there may not be enough Helium-3 fuel on earth to supply it .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY We do n't have many natural disasters so that means we have some of the best places to put it .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Any such material is transported in containers designed to ensure safety in any circumstance .
__label__OTHER The logic in making it a generalisation is obviously flawed .
__label__OTHER New techniques could extend this to 30,000 years , even 60,000 .
__label__RENEWABLES People dont know that in the production of PV nitrous trifluoride is released , which is a 17,200 times stronger greenhouse gas than CO2 , thus completely defeating PV .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE Public ignorance of general industrial standards of performance means that trivial incidents can acquire high profile in media .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY So of course the first jets had construction mistakes and crashed , but we learned and build better jets .
__label__OTHER Australia has all ready enough power .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS “ Money could be spent on other energies ” Why would anyone in his right mind want to spend money on something else where he would either get less energy , prevent less CO2 , cause more deaths and more pollution ?
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Even if these technologies were ready , they would n’t be deployable commercially for another two decades .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It is dangerous and why cant they save it for when the world runs out of the power we are using now ?
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Waste not properly isolated from the public and the generally accessible environment may contaminate air , soil , and water supplies . ”
__label__OTHER Thirdly it has n't happened for many years in most countries .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY My reasons are because it can exsplode and kill thousands of people in lots of locations in the world .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE If you bring in a talented marketing agency you could not only raise the awareness you could even make it sexy , then people will be demanding it .
__label__OTHER Should the welfare of our planet be looked at in profit and loss terms .
__label__OTHER It 's suitable for shipping , particularly for vessels that spend a lot of time at sea , this is why it has proven most useful for military applications for submarines that are often away for many months at a time ( 6 ) - the UK 's Trident fleet is nuclear , as are most aircraft carriers in US and European navies .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS It is broadly accessible , there is a lot in storage , and it is believed that the supply is going to last much , much longer than that of fossil fuels that are used in the same capacity .
__label__WASTE Civil waste and spent fuel storage is also robust and often below ground level .
__label__WASTE The currently favoured ‘ solution ’ of burying the waste in bedrock and sealing off access for ever is desperate and irresponsible .
__label__WASTE In the meantime , dry-cask storage can get us through the coming century , but those used fuel rods will remain a problem for at least another 9,900 years after that .
__label__RENEWABLES Declaring that renewables can not do the job is downright stupid .
__label__WASTE Storage is safe and secure , plans are well in hand for eventual disposal .
__label__OTHER They Do Just Fine With Neculer Power .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__WASTE Australia is a stable country which means we do n't have many natural disasters so there is minimal danger and it is easy to store waste safely .
__label__WASTE This waste has to be maintained , monitored and guarded to prevent the materials from falling into the wrong hands .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Australia has many places far away from everybody so no one would get hurt .
__label__COSTS __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The more technology is available and the more different opportunities you have for reducing emissions , the less costly those pathways [ to 2 C ] tend to be ,  he said .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Again , if it is all about CO2 then why is n’t the USA building NPPs ?
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__PUBLIC_DEBATE For example , billions of becquerels of radiation leaking from Fukushima are thrown around to lay audiences who have no idea what a becquerel is .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE The thinking is that big corporations are motivated only to distort the truth , minimize legal exposure , withhold information , and to make money at the expense of the public good if necessary .
__label__OTHER There are simply many good things to say .
__label__OTHER World-wide recognized climate experts like Fred Singer have been highly critical of AGW .
__label__OTHER It will also be a good job to get money and kids might study on it .
__label__WASTE Finaly we can store it safely .
__label__OTHER However when you look at the extensive list of pros you mentioned I think like you probably , wow why has n’t this process been studied and restudied over and over since the early 60 ’s .
__label__COSTS So hoping for much lower cost is possible , but for now this is wishful thinking .
__label__COSTS The Jervis Bay plan eventually was dropped mainly due to economic considerations .
__label__OTHER Nevertheless , all this means is that we have to remain open to future replacements of theoretical positions , but holding such positions , even if temporarily , is necessary for us to be able to operate in the real world .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It is dangerous because it is been droped on Japan , Russia and other countries .
__label__OTHER Otherwise is hard to beat .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Not only so , they are a sought-after risk because of their high engineering and operational standards .
__label__OTHER It is one of the significant sources of power all through the country .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Rendering parts of our planet permanently uninhabitable is more than a “ thorny ” problem .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Efforts to recycle it into consumer goods threaten our health .
__label__COSTS * Low operating costs ( relatively ) .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It flagrantly contradicts with the thoughts of sustainability if future generations have to deal with dangerous waste generated from preceding generations .
__label__WASTE Wastes are contained and managed , not released .
__label__WASTE __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY For now , I do n't think it 's a good idea because it can be dangerous and because it produces a lot of dangerous waste .
__label__OTHER In fact , considering all inputs including waste management , less than 6 % of the output is required , usually only 2-3 % .
__label__OTHER It is a waste of valuable resources and should not be pursued .
__label__WASTE You Can Put Neucler Waste In Less Populated Areas .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES When you consider the world ’s energy needs , green is a joke .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Even a major accident and meltdown as at Fukushima in 2011 would not endanger its neighbours .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Some people say that it is really dangerous because if one small thing goes wrong it can cause big destruction but I say Australia is a very stable place .
__label__RENEWABLES When there are so many cheaper , safer , cleaner and more sustainable alternatives , why the debate ?
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__WEAPONS He notes that ' If we banned everything that can be used to kill people , we would never have harnessed fire . '
__label__WEAPONS The local fuel processing of the breeder and burner configurations eliminates the possibility of diversion during transport .
__label__WEAPONS Safeguards would detect any diversion .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Petrol tankers on a public road are more of a hazard than any radioactive material in transit anywhere .
__label__OTHER Do n’t we at the very least risk putting off implementation of programs that will greatly improve our planet until it is to late or very difficult at best to reverse the effects of continued population growth and the negatives associated with this growth .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS And it ’s a similar case for oil as it ’s virtually all used for transport - nuclear power ca n’t take its place .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT This lack of greenhouse gases can be very attractive to some consumers .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Dishonest representation of the potential of other low carbon alternatives does not add extra credibility to MSR and it does not help the sense of urgency among developers of MSR to claim that there is no real competition .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE The extensive coverage of such accidents was distorted heavily by the mass media and distorted even further by the ignorant population that believed them .
__label__COSTS __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Modern designs are modular , smaller and quicker to build ( less interest costs ) , thus further improving economics .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It has also exploded in Russia , the same thing happened to Japan .
__label__RENEWABLES The FFI is taking advantage of the fact that 98 % of the public do not understand the basic physics of energy and many of them have been duped into believing that wind and solar can supply the world ’s energy needs .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE Yet many of the articles that describe their lives still , out of oxymoronic habit , use scare phrases like “ toxic wasteland , ” “ most highly contaminated on earth , ” and so on .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Perhaps most significantly , it will squander the resources necessary to implement meaningful climate change solutions .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE IT IS PROPAGANDA for the low information audience and the green zealots .
__label__COSTS __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It will be secure and not harm anyone and it will save us fortunes .
__label__RELIABILITY The best part is that this energy has a persistent supply .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE He abhors adjectives , like “ devastating , ” “ disastrous , ” and the like , and instead goes for numbers to render comparisons visible , a practice that is vigorously shunned by fear mongers .
__label__OTHER The profitability of selling hydrocarbons will be diminished long before they lose significant sales volume measured by amount of material , not by dollar value .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT First , it 's not carbon-free , no matter what the advocates tell you .
__label__WASTE Also , once the fuel is used , you ca n’t simply take it to the landfill – it ’s radioactive and dangerous .
__label__COSTS In which time , with greener technology always under development , it could fall behind or become obsolete by the time of completion .
__label__OTHER They also say that many countries have problems with the source of energy but their wrong most of the countries are doing just fine .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE The cons are just the standard greenpeace lies .
__label__OTHER I do n't really have to answer this for the primary objective of showing the sustainability of progress , because I need only show that it is economical enough to sustain progress .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Lots of countries have not had accident so why should we .
__label__OTHER When corporations are confronted with the environmental pollution , concern for profitability dictates that efforts will be made to merely clean up the mess , rather than change the structures responsible for the pollution .
__label__COSTS __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Advances in technology will bring the cost down further in the future . "
__label__COSTS __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT In other words , profitability of this environmentally sound technology is minimal .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__WASTE While recycling efforts of this waste product have been undertaken in recent years , the storage of the by-product could lead to contamination through leaks or containment failures .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Quite to the contrary especially wind power and solar power is reducing cost so fast that the window of opportunity for MSR is closing fast simply because being able to produce energy with MSR ’s is not enough you also have to be competitive in the market place .
__label__COSTS Experience to date gives a good idea of costs and earlier estimates are being revised downwards .
__label__COSTS Some argue against its economic viability as well .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Alleviating the potential for one environmental catastrophe by creating another one is not the answer .
__label__RENEWABLES At present , there is a worrisome groundswell of opinion that renewable energy is sufficient to hit that target , Wigley of the University of Adelaide said .
__label__WASTE Waste lasts 200 – 500 thousand years .
__label__WASTE And once the fuel is spent , you ca n't just throw it in the city dump .
__label__OTHER The available resources may be spread so thin that agencies are unable adequately to pursue protection of the physical environment and natural resources .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Secondly , Australia is a stable country so we will rarely have natural disasters.Thirdly , it is a back up power source in case we run out of resources .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It is a permanent ‘ dead zone .
__label__OTHER Further , the transport casks are massive because of the required amounts of shielding .
__label__WASTE And it is incorrect to call it waste , because 95 percent of the potential energy is still contained in the used fuel after the first cycle .
__label__WASTE Ninety-five percent of a spent fuel rod is plain old U-238 , the nonfissionable variety that exists in granite tabletops , stone buildings and the coal burned in coal plants to generate electricity .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Keeley said the market " is n't delivering to us what we actually want , " but instead is providing a " flood of electricity from super-cheap natural gas , which is cleaner than coal but is n't really clean . "
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The the WHO , UN , etc. , ca n’t be trusted in their belief that NPPs are safe and environmentally harmless .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION If people can be convinced that starting endless wars and maintaining 1400 overseas military bases has anything to do with providing security for the nation , surely a simple but sustained ad campaign could define thorium power as something entirely different from the bad nuclear power plants that melted down in Fukushima .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Having studied many reports and original ORNL documents regarding LFTR , it turns out that LFTR is truly dreadful technology .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Rickover ’s and France ’s experience with sodium cooled reactors has shown that the violent water / sodium chemical reaction makes this design unreliable .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Chernobyl , a graphite moderated design , shows the horrors of combustible moderators / coolants in a sever accident scenario .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION The fuel salt is not suited for long term or intermediate storage : like in the MSRE reactor experiment it would disintegrate and very likely get set free in case such a ship would sink .
__label__WASTE Reprocessing LWR waste to use it as LFTR fuel has been mentioned by several of the scientists .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The problem which has been the focus of much attention by French researchers , is that ORNL ’s single fluid MSBR had a safety flaw in the ORNL one fluid design that if not corrected , could cause loss of control in the ORNL designed one fluid MSBR .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Meanwhile , with demand for power soaring in emerging markets , China and India are aggressively experimenting with thorium , an element that is more fertile and abundant than uranium , and less hazardous .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Why is corrosion still a problem despite +60 years when it was first recognized ?
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Also separation is far from perfect : if 1 % of the thorium is going to waste every cycle ( a value the Russians ( more advance than the US in this field ) hope to reach in the near future ) roughly 30 % of the thorium goes to waste every year when a 10 days cycle is used .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Given that our world is seriously in need of the kind of generating capacity that a thorium based reactor network could produce , the fact that we are not building these stations right now is one of today ’s most heinous scandals .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION First setting up a research reactor adjacent to an inferior lwr that is nearing the end of its life would be extremely beneficial in many ways , first the waste at the site could be used to fuel the msr to start and reach critical , second the heat exchanger should have a build in still or electrolysis tank for seperating deuterium and tritium since the water would be brought above the necesarry temperatures anyway , this still could produce heavy water for candu style reactors as a moderator , but also high voltage plus heavy water makes neutrons which would be beneficial to a beam driven thorium setup , also seperate tritium and use it for research into fusion or for other applications ( currently priced at around $ 30,000 a Gram ) this still would also purify sea water to fresh potable water , from water that had run through the lwr and remove any tritium caused by stray neutrons .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION p.s. Running a LFTR under water or even on board a ship is a really bad idea : the reactor may be a good design on land , but it is just not compatible with water .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Do we really want to invest in more fission technology , LFTR and similar , when LENR do not have these problems ?
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION LFTR proponents are just getting a “ free ride ” at public expense , just like all the waste Tokomak fusion research ( 100 billion USD ) , that has not yet yielded any commercial fusion reactor design ?
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION The World Nuclear Association estimates the world 's thorium supply at more than 5.3 million tons , with India ranked first .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Corrosion could be an issue if the chemical balance is incorrect .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In a two-liquid arrangement ( core and surrounding Thorium blanket as neutron reflector ) , a graphite or Hastelloy-N separating barrier could fail , e.g. due to thermal stress , corrosion and/or neutron embrittlement , such that cleaning up a LFTR after missing of core and blanket would be one unholy mess and extremely hazardous due to the high Gamma flux .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__WASTE Not only do Thorium LFTR plants produce just a small fraction of the nuclear waste produced by current plants , they can also consume much of our existing nuclear waste stockpiles by adding certain amounts of this waste directly into the liquid Thorium/Molten Salt core of an operating LFTR plant .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Even with only 0.1 % loss and a 10 day cycle something like 2/3 of the thorium would end up in the wast .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION It should also be noted that LFTR run at criticality with all its inherent control problems , even if the melt has a negative temperature coefficient offset by graphite positive coefficient .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Leslie Dewan , co-founder and chief science officer at Transatomic Power – a nuclear power start-up that uses a spent uranium process similar to thorium — said in an interview that thorium has " significant safety advantages . "
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION __label__WASTE The myth about Thorium LFTR should be destroyed , and a sensible pragmatic approach taken via renewables ; they do not generate any form of radioactive waste !
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Personally I would task/reward/encourage every University in the UK to produce a working Thorium Reactor model every year .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION If our ( U.S. ) government were committed to developing a superior nuclear technology , such as the LFTR , it could find ways to make it happen and to be deployed .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION It 's precisely the memories of Fukushima and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster that make thorium reactors seem appealing to some .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION In this way LFTR designs can actually consume the still substantial heat of nuclear waste to generate useful electrical power from this formerly unwanted and greatly feared by-product .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION Cochran said that both SMRs and thorium have features that make them more attractive than traditional plants .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION The Protactinium decays naturally in 27 days to U233 and that is considered one of the admirable outcomes of the Thorium Cycle .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Taking into account the carbon-equivalent emissions associated with the entire nuclear life cycle , nuclear plants contribute significantly to climate change and will contribute even more as stockpiles of highgrade uranium are depleted . "
__label__RELIABILITY Further , at current global nuclear capacity , known uranium resources will last only 34 years . "
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear energy extracts by far more energy from the natural resource Uranium than does the exploitation of oil or any other natural resource .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Just one uranium pellet has a comparable output of ( 8 ) 17,000 cubic feet of methane , 149 gallons of crude oil or 1,780 lb of coal and it is infinitely cleaner too .
__label__RELIABILITY Nuclear power is a very useful source of energy , plus we have a third of the worlds uranium .
__label__COSTS The cost of the uranium , which is utilized as a fuel in this process , is low .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS The amount of fuel required by nuclear power plant is comparatively less than what is required by other power plants as energy released by nuclear fission is approximately ten million times greater than the amount of energy released by fossil fuel atom .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS For all this , it 's worth noting that uranium is a very efficient energy source : One ton of natural uranium can produce the same number of kilowatt-hours as 16,000 tons of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__RELIABILITY * The majority of known uranium around the world lies under land controlled by tribes or indigenous peoples who do n’t support it being mined from the earth .
__label__RELIABILITY How long can we expect supplies of Uranium and nuclear energy to last ?
__label__COSTS It is pretty expensive to mine , refine and transport uranium .
__label__COSTS Uranium is also less expensive to procure and transport , which further lowers the cost .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The process of mining and refining uranium has n’t been a clean process .
__label__RELIABILITY A large amount of uranium ore needs to be mined , milled , refined and enriched in order to produce that little tiny pellet that has the energy of many coal hopper cars .
__label__RELIABILITY Uranium is a scarce resource , its supply is estimated to last only for the next 30 to 60 years depending on the actual demand .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Uranium miners experience higher rates of lung cancer , tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS The amount of Uranium on the earth is n’t NEARLY enough to sustain us for long enough to relieve the need of fossil fuels , we ’re talking no more than 80 years for the remaining Uranium to be mined and used .
__label__OTHER Remember , fluoride volatility extracts uranium very effectively , and is currently used in making LWR fuel ( it works , and equipment is NRC-approved ) .
__label__RELIABILITY The quantity of available uranium is limited and will reduce .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__RENEWABLES The on-the-ground footprint of nuclear power , through its plants and uranium mines , is about 1,000 times larger than it is for wind .
__label__COSTS Even if the cost of uranium goes up , the impact on the cost of power will be that much lower .
__label__COSTS It would also be cheap for our country because we have a third of the worlds uranium .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE The worldwide anti-nuclear power movement has provided enormous stimulation to the Australian movement , and the decline in nuclear power expansion since the late 1970s - due substantially to worldwide citizen opposition - has been a great setback for Australian uranium mining interests .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS At present , our nuclear energy is produced by “ fission ” which is process of splitting an atom ( 18 ) ; the energy release is millions of times more efficient than burning of coal or gas .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE The Inquiry did in fact analyse the overall dangers of the nuclear industry and concluded that no decision on uranium mining should occur without public debate .
__label__RELIABILITY What if we run out uranium ?
__label__RELIABILITY In a pinch , uranium could even be extracted from sea water with little impact on electrical costs .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Uranium enrichment plants are major emitters of chemicals which damage the ozone layer , specifically CFC-114 ( Freon ) used as coolant .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Uranium sources are just as finite as other fuel sources , such as coal , natural gas , etc. , and are expensive to mine , refine , and transport , and produce considerable environmental waste ( including greenhouse gasses ) during all of these processes .
__label__RELIABILITY Uranium , the nuclear fuel that is used to produced nuclear energy is limited and can not be produced again and again on demand .
__label__OTHER When you take into account every nuclear plant on Earth , the combined total climbs to roughly 2,000 metric tons a year [ source : NEI ] .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Although it takes about 20 times more mining for coal as it does for the same amount of uranium , one still has to consider the environmental damage from the radiaton gases being released into the atmosphere , the groundwater contamination and the radioactive dust in the air .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY I know some people will say we will run out of uranium eventually and if a meltdown happens it will kill thousands of people .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__RELIABILITY In fact , 58 % of global uranium supplies come from only three countries and its processing as fuel can only be carried out in six countries .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT What about the mining of Uranium , and what general environmental risks might this pose ?
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Historically , mining and purifying uranium has n't been a very clean process .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE Mass mobilisation against uranium also challenges capitalism by bringing under scrutiny the rationale of pursuing profitability at the expense of social responsibility and by direct economic blows to corporate profitability .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Nuclear power is alleged to be beneficial , but uranium mining is a severe cultural threat to Aborigines , who are already a strongly oppressed group in Australia .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS It is said that the world 's uranium fuel supply should last in the region of 90 years ( 15 ) - which is not a huge amount of time ; the oil reserve is said to be around sixty years .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS While coal , NG , and petroleum are bound to rise and decline , much of the uranium has not been mined and lots more have not been discovered .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Mining and milling operators must deal with mill tailings â € ” the radioactive material left over after the uranium has been extracted from the oreâ € ” as well as waste rock and radiologically contaminated equipment .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Uranium is potentially hazardous to miners ' health .
__label__RELIABILITY There is only 50 years worth of high uranium ores left in the world .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Uranium mining can also damage the environment .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Moreover , one in five uranium miners in the Southwest has contracted some form of cancer .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY If direct action by workers began to be sustained through community support , it is quite possible that other channels for stopping uranium mining could come into play : the government - especially a Labor government - might back away from confrontation with unions supported by the community , or corporations might decide investment in this controversial area was too risky .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Just 1kg of uranium , for example , produces the same energy as 2000 metric tonnes of coal ( 1 ) .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__COSTS The cost of uranium will spike : The amount of uranium is limited and will decline with more nuclear power plants .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Conventional mining has caused dust and radon inhalation for workers – resulting in high rates of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases – and both types of mining have caused serious contamination of groundwater . "
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS People dont know that coal plants blow out and release radon , thorium and uranium in large quantities , About 800.000 tonnes uranium globally and 2 mio tonnes thorium .
__label__RELIABILITY In the whole fuel cycle , nuclear power uses nearly as much energy as it produces .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear fission produces roughly a million times more energy per unit weight than fossil fuel alternatives [ source : Helman ] .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT There may be only 200 years left of all uranium ores including poor uranium ores which take more energy to mine and process and thus release more carbon emissions .
__label__OTHER Nuclear provides 14 % of world electricity .
__label__COSTS As you have a massive concentration of power in very small quantities of uranium , the costs to produce energy decrease drastically .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Mining uranium is very dangerous for workers " The Case Against Nuclear Power " .
__label__WASTE The same quantity of energy if it came from nuclear reactions would make fourteen thousand tons of high level waste .
__label__RELIABILITY The reserves of uranium ores used to generate nuclear power are going to run out .
__label__RELIABILITY There is not enough uranium to sustain nuclear power beyond a few decades .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Uranium mining , milling , leeching , plant construction and decommissioning all produce substantial amounts of GHG .
__label__OTHER Uranium deposits are relatively common .
__label__COSTS Uranium is further subject to large price hikes since the resource is only available to a few countries .
__label__RELIABILITY And there 's heaps of energy stored away in those tiny uranium atoms , which could provide plenty of power for the future .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__PUBLIC_DEBATE __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY However , by 1974 sections of the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) and the public generally were becoming concerned with the hazards of uranium mining and the impact of mining on traditional Aboriginal communities .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Abandoned mines from the Cold War era continue to pose contamination problems in the Navajo Nation.Â ( Today , most of the uranium used in American reactors comes from Canada , Australia , and Russia . )
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__WASTE Uranium mining is the first step in the nuclear power cycle ; it has taken the lives of many miners all over the world causing environmental contamination , cancers and nuclear waste .
__label__RENEWABLES People dont know that radioactive tailings are produced in the production process of neodynium for windmills , and that neodynium is therefore no longer produced in the USA .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS In fact , a gram of uranium can generate as much electricity as four tonnes of coal .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Greenhouse gases are emitted throughout the nuclear fuel chain , from mining the uranium , its enrichment , transportation and the construction of the plants .
__label__RELIABILITY Uranium is Finite : Just like other sources of fuel , uranium is also finite and exists in few of the countries .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY The danger was further demonstrated in November 1983 when Labor Caucus , at the initiative of Cabinet , gave the go-ahead for Roxby Downs , potentially the largest uranium mine in the world .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Uranium mining , which creates serious health and environmental problems , has disproportionately impacted indigenous people because much of the world ’s uranium is located under indigenous land .
__label__RELIABILITY The fuel necessary to generate energy is uranium and the power originated from the nuclear fission of its atoms produces an incredible amount of energy .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Environmental Impact : One of the biggest issues is environmental impact in relation to uranium .
__label__OTHER Also , directly mining Uranium is not the only source we can use .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__FOSSIL_FUELS According to the Nuclear Energy Institute , the power produced by the world 's nuclear plants would normally produce 2 billion metric tons of CO2 per year if they depended on fossil fuels .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Furthermore , according to research by Friends of the Earth , if the extremely polluting and dangerous mining and refining of uranium are included in the running of nuclear plants , they emit 250,000 tons of CO2 for every year of operation .
__label__COSTS In India , the country with the most recent experience of nuclear reactor construction , completion costs for the last 10 reactors have , on average , been 300 % over budget .
__label__COSTS However , high construction costs have hindered the development of nuclear power in many countries .
__label__COSTS When it comes to new plants being built now in Europe , " the outlook there is discouraging as well — you 're seeing patterns of cost increases as well , " Nogee said .
__label__WASTE __label__ENERGY_POLICY If the industry does not pay the total costs of disposing of nuclear waste and ensuring it is safe for thousand of years then this is a subsidy .
__label__COSTS As nuclear plants are notorious for cost overruns , the higher figure is much more likely .
__label__OTHER Some people say it 's going to be in responsible hands but if the nuclear power gets in the wrong hands it can all go wrong .
__label__COSTS This instability at the heart of the production of nuclear power , combined with the long-lived and extreme toxicity of the resulting byproducts , leads to the second insurmountable issue with nuclear power : its expense .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The more nuclear power plants ( and nuclear waste storage shelters ) are built , the higher is the probability of a disastrous failure somewhere in the world . "
__label__COSTS All of these services and added materials cost money -- on top of the high costs required to build a plant .
__label__COSTS April 16th , 2006 : " [ Claim ] Nuclear energy is expensive .
__label__COSTS These administrations and included materials cost cash – on top of the high expenses needed to put together a plant , which may make it less desirable to invest in .
__label__COSTS Nuclear power stations are expensive : Nuclear power is by far the most expensive form of energy that has ever been carried out on an industrial scale .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY And it costs the federal government NOTHING more than backing the loans .
__label__COSTS Nuclear : The crowning mother of expenses , nuclear is the blunt force of power generation for things like super-heavy industrial use or large cities .
__label__COSTS Still , the greatest stumbling block nuclear power might face is cost .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In the case of a nuclear disaster , most of the damages will be paid by society and not the companies ' insurances .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In other words , the operation of a nuclear plant is premised on constant control over a fundamentally uncontrollable process .
__label__COSTS __label__WASTE Nuclear waste disposal is costly Digging massive holes in mountains , transporting nuclear waste to these designated waste areas , and monitoring the waste areas for radiation leakages are all significant costs associated with nuclear energy .
__label__OTHER To maintain the current proportional contribution of nuclear power would require building eighty new nuclear plants in the next 10 years — commissioning one every 6 weeks !
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Although construction of safe nuclear power plants may be feasible , and may help meet rising energy needs in the short term , ignoring the longer term implications of nuclear power may lead to even bigger problems .
__label__COSTS Rising capital and operating costs are making new projects more and more unattractive .
__label__COSTS Sizewell B , the UK ’s most recent power station cost the taxpayer around £ 3.7 billion just to install Decommissioning and cleaning up all of our current nuclear sites is costing more than £ 70 billion .
__label__COSTS A new nuclear power station will take at least 10 years to build and longer to generate electricity .
__label__COSTS The cost of decommissioning will be an enormous sum and the final total is unknown .
__label__COSTS If the nuclear energy option is ignored , nations would have to pay a larger bill to achieve their goals , Fawcett said .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The production of electricity from splitting apart uranium atoms is an inherently unstable process liable at any moment to run away , out of control .
__label__COSTS The report goes on to say : “ The risks faced by developers [ of new nuclear plants ] … are so large and variable that individually they could each bring even the largest utility company to its knees financially . ”
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__WASTE The more nuclear power plants ( and nuclear waste storage shelters ) are built , the higher is the probability of a disastrous failure somewhere in the world .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY They say no one knows whats going to happen to the nuclear energy but if it 's in a good place and no one does anything dangerous with the nuclear power it will be finePeople also say we will sell it to other countries for money I think that 's a good idea because our country would have more money .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Consequently , the government has to subsidize the costs .
__label__COSTS While the average construction time is seven years , eight of the reactors have been under construction for more than 20 years .
__label__OTHER It is now asking for $ 100 billion .
__label__COSTS Nuclear plant construction runs over-time and over-budget " The case against nuclear power " .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Wall Street wo n’t finance one unless taxpayers co-sign , and the nuclear industry tried and failed to obtain more than $ 100 billion in federal loan guarantees .
__label__COSTS But increasing reliance on nuclear power is one of the costliest ways to achieve that goal .
__label__COSTS Critics also say that it can take decades to put an effective nuclear program into action ( 12 ) .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Nuclear energy relies too heavily on subsidies/taxpayers " The Case Against Nuclear Power " .
__label__COSTS If one were to try and figure out how much a new plant might cost by looking at the last generation of nuclear power plants , " on average , cost overruns there were equal to three times the pre-construction projections , so if it was supposed to cost $ 1 billion , it cost $ 3 billion , " he explained .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Technically less advanced countries with nuclear power stations increases the safety risks .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY That ’s because a Construction / Operating Licensing would never be granted to a reactor configuration that could potentially continue to fission under certain accident scenarios ( the result of fuel having a positive temp .
__label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY They know it is both far too dangerous and far too expensive .
__label__COSTS Such a release could cost up to $ 2.1 trillion , and would force the permanent relocation of 11.1 million people . "
__label__COSTS [ ... ] Worldwide , the cost of building a nuclear reactor is consistently two to three times higher than the nuclear industry estimates .
__label__COSTS Building nuclear power plants takes too long It can take between 20 to 30 years to move from the planning to the opening of a nuclear reactor .
__label__COSTS The price tag for a new nuclear reactor is the biggest obstacle .
__label__COSTS The costs of evacuation and environmental remediation , and those of the loss of usable land , could be enormous .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY The Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act , first passed in 1957 and last renewed in 2005 , restricts any costs payable by utility companies in the event of a nuclear accident to $ 12.6 billion .
__label__COSTS __label__ENERGY_POLICY January 24 , 2008 : " Despite its promise more than 50 years ago of energy “ too cheap to meter , ” the nuclear power industry continues to be dependent on taxpayer handouts to survive .
__label__COSTS In a recent estimate , the UK government calculated that cleaning up the country ’s ageing nuclear facilities will exceed 73 billion pounds ( USD 100 billion ) .
__label__WASTE Building new nuclear plants would mean the production of much more of this dangerous waste with no where for it to go . "
__label__RELIABILITY __label__COSTS January 8 , 2008 : " Nuclear is not an available power source in the Philippines , and , given the DOE ’s power forecasts , a nuclear plant will be a poor choice to meet power demand because it takes too long to build .
__label__COSTS __label__WEAPONS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__WASTE Despite what the nuclear industry tells us , building enough nuclear power stations to make a meaningful reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would cost trillions of dollars , create tens of thousands of tons of lethal high-level radioactive waste , contribute to further proliferation of nuclear weapons materials , and result in a Chernobyl-scale accident once every decade .
__label__COSTS In most cases , the decommissioning process costs between US $ 300 million to US$ 5.6 billion .
__label__COSTS __label__ENERGY_POLICY According to a report cited inScientific American , the costs to the taxpayer of building 100 new nuclear power plants , over the lifetime of the plants , over and above costs associated with alternatives if they had been pursued , come to a truly gargantuan $ 1.9 – 4.1 trillion .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Nuclear power stations are so dangerous that no insurance company will undertake to pay the total costs of a disaster or a terrorist attack .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS Nuclear plants need two decades to build , and the mining of uranium fuel is carbon-polluting , he said .
__label__FOSSIL_FUELS Natural gas , a fossil fuel , is too expensive already , and its price is too volatile to risk building big baseload plants .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Since its inception in 1948 , this industry has received tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies but remains unable to compete economically on its own .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY That 's more of a risk associated with overseas reactors , but if the U.S. signals that it will build a whole new generation of plants , that greatly increases the odds that the rest of the world will want to do that as well ,  Nogee said .
__label__COSTS January 8 , 2008 - " No nuclear power station anywhere in the world has ever been built on time and on budget with the average reactor costing three times as much and twice as long to build .
__label__WEAPONS Some people say that it will get into the wrong hands .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY When the utilities default on these loans , taxpayers will foot the bill .
__label__COSTS Decommissioning nuclear power plants is expensive " The case against nuclear power " .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Again , without that indemnity , without the government subsidies and loan guarantees , and tax breaks , the nuclear industry could not exist ; the laws of the free market are not allowed to apply to nuclear power .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY * High subsidies needed for construction and operation , as well as loan guarantees .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__WASTE __label__ENERGY_POLICY ( This means that either no one will be responsible for physical , environmental , or health damages in the case of an accident or leakage over time from waste storage , or that the government will ultimately have to cover the cost of any damages . )
__label__COSTS January 8 , 2008 : " Decommissioning nuclear plants also cost a lot of money .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__ENERGY_POLICY Taxpayers , not nuclear industry , assume risks of disaster " 6 reasons against nuclear energy " .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Furthermore , nuclear reactors are so dangerous and so risky to build that no insurance company is even willing to insure such reactors against disasters or terrorist attacks .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT April/May 2006 : " The best case against nuclear power as a global warming remedy begins with the fact that nuclear-generated electricity is very expensive .
__label__COSTS Each nuclear power plant costs around £ 5 billion to build .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__WASTE __label__ENERGY_POLICY However , if the nuclear industry is so confident in the ' safety ' of its reactors and the long-lived radioactive wastes that they produce , why must the American taxpayer indemnify the industry against the financial consequences of nuclear accident through the Price Anderson Act ?
__label__OTHER Because there are few nuclear power plants , the average distance that the produced electricity has to travel is quite long .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The potential risks of nuclear power - for example from meltdown accidents at nuclear power plants - were too large to be taken by even the largest corporations .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Moreover , as we ’ve witnessed to our cost , the large nuclear power plants are all too liable to damage caused by extrinsic ( and uncontrollable ) factors .
__label__COSTS In Finland , the construction of a new reactor is already € 1.5 billion over budget . "
__label__COSTS In other words : It is an illusion to build new nuclear power plants in a short time .
__label__COSTS __label__WASTE The unresolved problem of long-term waste disposal — the U.S. government has pledged to sequester the waste for 1 million years — contributes to the astronomical cost of decommissioning nuclear power plants .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Adding more nuclear reactors to a site simply makes it more vulnerable to attacks by increasing the number of targets or making the target bigger .
__label__COSTS __label__WASTE On top of this , the cost of building a nuclear waste dump costs around USD 29 billion . "
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Insurance companies will not insure nuclear reactors so the risk devolves on to government .
__label__COSTS Nuclear plants are too expensive .
__label__COSTS Exorbitant Cost : Cost estimates for new reactor construction continue to soar and are unpredictable .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS But as Michael Grunwald noted in Time , recent price estimates for a large plant in Florida came in at $ 12 billion to $ 18 billion , and that 's before you consider the fact that the nuclear industry has a history of 250-percent cost overruns.Some analysts say alternative methods would yield much more climate-saving bang for our buck than nuclear power .
__label__COSTS __label__ENERGY_POLICY A serious reactor accident could cost as much as $ 600 billion , the balance of which would likely be paid by taxpayers .
__label__WASTE Building new nuclear power stations would increase the most toxic high level waste five-fold .
__label__COSTS Analysts questioned Korsnick about the industry 's high upfront capital costs for new reactors and reports that licensing for some new reactor designs could reach up to $ 1 billion .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Nuclear power should be banned from Austraila if a meltdown happens it will kill tens of thousands of people .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Others would say it is an abomination to use nuclear power it , could kill thousands in fact it could destroy all of Sydney so therefor it is a ridiculous idea .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY If Australia had a nuclear power plant and it had a meltdown Australia would be in devastated .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY nuclear power should be banded from Australia because it is dangerous .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT What is the point of nuclear power in Austraila its just a waist of space .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY The Premier , Mr Brian Burke , said that the Cabinet had reaffirmed that in no circumstances would a nuclear power station be built in WA .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ENERGY_POLICY She said her party rules out conceeding this issue to the SNP , in the event of any coalition or policy negotiations , and that Labour stands by its pledge made in the last government that new nuclear is needed to help the UK to reduce its carbon emissions and meet future electricity demand .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Australia should use nuclea power because it does n't release green house gasses , this is good for the the enviroment .
__label__OTHER I stongly believe that Australia should use nuclear power .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Australia has most of the worlds uranium and if Australia has that much they should start using it or selling it.Therefore I think that is enough reasons to have to start having more nuclear plants .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Australia should use it because France and Germany has been using it for 50 years and as had not one miner issue it has n't blown up yet We will not have as much green house gases .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Secondly , nuclear energy is a backup power source for solar power if it is a cloudy day this would be a backup power source.Thirdly , Australia is a stable country so we will rarely have natural disaster and that 's why I want nuclear power plants in Australia .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It should be band from Australia.If terrorists come they can target the power plant and it would kill heaps of people .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Firstly If Australia does not use nuclear energy Australia would let off greenhouse gasses .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY [ Answer ] : Chernobyl was the worst .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The 9/11 atrocity would be tiny by comparison .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY January 8 , 2008 : " The Three mile Island and Chernobyl accidents should never be downplayed .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The risk of a meltdown , even a partial one , is extremely low .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Moreover , the cancer rate in the Chernobyl region is well below that of Australia , which is to say that radiation is , at worst , a very weak carcinogen .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The psychological health damage alleged by PANE is no closer to an event in the environment or to environmental concerns .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Any risk of another Chernobyl or Mile High is intolerable " The case against nuclear power " .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The conventional , but false , claim that radiation is harmful down to the smallest dose and the slowest rate of delivery ignores and denies this evolutionary principle .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Just last month , a study was published that found thyroid cancer rates among children in the Fukushima Prefecture were 20 to 50 percent higher than children outside the prefecture .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The number of firemen , those most heavily exposed during the first few days after the onset of the fire ( it was not a nuclear explosion ) , who died from their exposure was 28 out of about 600 .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS In particular , there is evidence of cancer clusters linked to nuclear power production .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE One of the interesting things about modern nuclear power in the US is that few really understand how it works day to day -- including most experts who are commenting to the media on the topic .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The basis is a belief that NPP disasters are just waiting to happen .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The immediate loss of life , in the tens of thousands , coupled with the invisible and long-term effects of radiation sickness and cancers , brought the world up against the sharp razor edge of the nuclear age .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT April 16th , 2006 : " Three Mile Island was in fact a success story : The concrete containment structure did just what it was designed to do -- prevent radiation from escaping into the environment .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS This radioactivity enters the human body through breathing and the food chain , as gases and tiny metal particles .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In it we explain the essentials of nuclear reactors and radiation biology aimed at a lay public and show , among other things , that contrary to the anti-nuclear mantra , nuclear energy has the best safety record over the last several decades of any source of energy – by orders of magnitude .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Renewed operation of [ TMI-1 ] would cause severe psychological distress to PANE 's members and other persons living in the vicinity of the reactor .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE A major useful source to correct the fear mongering and distortions surrounding radiation – in particular exposing the erroneous linear-no-threshold ( LNT ) assumption used by all regulatory agencies ( outside of France ) as the basis of their regulatory policies – is to be found at the website of Scientists for Accurate Radiation Information ( SARI ) , an international organization of some 80 scientists , physicians , and others from 14 different countries around the world , to which we both belong .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY If a large plane were flown into a nuclear power station the disaster would be immeasurably worse than Chernobyl .
__label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY When necessary , design changes followed and extra safety protocols and features had to be put in place , this was perceived as unexpected cost increases .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The meltdown at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant was the worst since Chernobyl in Ukraine , 25 years earlier .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS All of us are exposed to natural radioactivity every minute , mostly from rocks and soil .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Yet in the event of an accident , existing evacuation plans have been found to be unrealistic .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Formal.standard :  [ Opposition argument :] Nuclear reactors are likely to have accidents with severe consequences for humanity .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT A recent book , Chernobyl : Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment , concludes that , based on records now available , some 985,000 people died between 1986 and 2004 , mainly of cancer , as a result of the Chernobyl accident .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS studies worldwide ( for a partial listing see Charles Sanders ’s 2009 book Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption and for a more complete , though more dated , listing see T.D. Luckey ’s 1991 book Radiation Hormesis ) to be false at the low-dose ranges to which most nuclear workers , accident responders , and nearby residents have been exposed .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY For his part , Gundersen has successively raised his estimates of the number of cancers that will result from Fukushima ’s meltdown after the quake and tsunami from a few hundred thousand to , again , the round figure of a million .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY Renewed operation of TMI 1 would cause severe harm to the stability , cohesiveness and well being of the communities in the vicinity of the reactor .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY But a risk of an accident is not an effect on the physical environment .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS In fact , national radiation protection standards fall short of protecting those most vulnerable to the harmful effects of radiation , basing their evaluation on impacts to a “ standard ” healthy , young , white adult male .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY [ Footnote 9 ] The NRC concluded that the risk of an accident had not changed significantly since the EIS for TMI-1 was prepared in 1972 .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The awesome destructiveness seen at Hiroshima is one of the products of nuclear fission .
__label__OTHER We will also guarantee a riskier future for us all .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Each accident was unique , and each was supposed to be impossible .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY For the hundreds of thousands of Japanese moved into temporary shelters either because their homes were washed away in the tsunami or because of the emergency evacuation caused by the nuclear crisis , there is very little prospect of moving back .
__label__OTHER Risk is a pervasive element of modern life ; to say more would belabor the obvious .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Although the casualties were not that high , but it caused serious environmental concerns .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY If the Fukushima reactors were automatically flooded as soon as the earthquake was detected , not manually and only several hours after the tsunami hit , there would have been no accident .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The Chernobyl accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine was the worst nuclear accident in the history .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY It ’s quite dangerous , but thanks to obviousness of the danger , precautions are taken .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS It can cause genetic mutations which lead to cancer .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY At Fukushima we have the worst industrial disaster ever .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY A September 2004 study by Dr. Ed Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists , using the NRC ’s own analysis method , found that a worst-case accident or attack at the Indian Point nuclear plant 35 miles north of New York City could cause up to 43,700 immediate fatalities and up to 518,000 long-term cancer deaths .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The authors arrived in part at their imaginary figure by attributing every death that occurred to the radiation from Chernobyl , as though suddenly all other causes of death stopped for the time being .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Organizations like the Sierra Club forcefully argue against the " numerous issues " that dog nuclear energy — despite the fact that , as backers point out , there has n't been an accident on U.S. soil since Three Mile Island 's meltdown in 1979 .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The potential for a reoccurrence of the accident will further stress the community infrastructure , causing increased loss of confidence and a breakdown of the social and political order .
__label__WEAPONS People around the world stood aghast at the apocalyptic destruction wreaked on Japan during a few hellish minutes when the United States dropped the nuclear bombs Little Boy and Fat Man on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The radiation has even caused genetic mutations in children whose parents were exposed to the radiation .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The total figures for deaths found by UNSCEAR and other international medical investigatory organizations was around 60 , which included 15 deaths over the ensuing years from thyroid cancer among those residents exposed as children and a number of delayed deaths among clean-up workers whose causes of death could in any way be related to radiation exposure .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY High risks : Despite a generally high security standard , accidents can still happen .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS While experts disagree over the definition of ' low dose , ' radiation protection measures are based on an assumption that even small amounts of radiation exposure may pose some small risk .
__label__OTHER It does not take a physicist to come to some understanding and approval of nuclear energy , just some open-minded investigation .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY October , 2001 : " The Chernobyl plant explosion released radiation into the surrounding area .
__label__ENERGY_POLICY __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The Chernobyl tragedy exhibits the failure of government planners , not an inherent danger of nuclear power .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Low levels of radiation comparable to those received naturally in some places are not harmful .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The Japanese thought that Fukushima Dai’ichi was invincible ; now , the wreck of Fukushima Dai’ichi ( i.e. triple meltdowns where the coriums have now bored though the primary containment into the ground via their own lava tubes , to reach the water table in the coming years ) is destroying all life in the Pacific Ocean ; billions of years of biological evolution in Pacific Ocean is being wrecked in a course of a few years .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS However , the truth is that nuclear power plants are a miniscule source of radiation .
__label__PUBLIC_DEBATE Respondent People Against Nuclear Energy ( PANE ) , an association of residents of the Harrisburg area who are opposed to further operation of either TMI reactor , responded to this invitation , contending that restarting TMI-1 would cause both severe psychological damage to persons living in the vicinity , and serious damage to the stability , cohesiveness , and well-being of neighboring communities .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS In this case , however , virtually the entire communities engaged in radiation protection , radiology , or health physics agree that either zero excess cancers will arise from Fukushima , or at worst the number will be undetectable against the background of cancers from all other causes .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY There ’s a subtext that a nuclear disaster ( like Deepwater Horizon ) will devastate the arctic .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY A weak ' safety culture ' within the NRC itself prevents effective oversight .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The nuclear catastrophe in Chernobyl ( in today ’s Ukraine ) in April 1986 caused widespread fear of nuclear power and strengthened the anti-nuclear sentiment .
__label__OTHER Radiation is like virtually all other agents , both chemical and physical , to which life has been exposed during the 3 billion or so years of life on earth .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Similar future catastrophes could be the result of an accident , sabotage by disgruntled employees or a terrorist attack .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Like Chernobyl had 50 deaths .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The additional contribution from all man-made sources of radiation is much smaller .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Possibly the largest hurdle of all is the fact that some wealthy and powerful interest groups have invested a great deal of time and money into building the myth that there is “ no safe dose ” of radiation because they know that the truth will enable nuclear energy to flourish at their expense in the energy supply market .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Renewed operation of TMI-1 may well cause psychological health problems for these people .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Fistly if its not properly secured something bad could happen and lots of people could die .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Compare that to the 4,000 people the World Health Organization estimates were victimized by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster ( and that number includes those born with genetic mutations following the meltdown ) , and nuclear seems like much less of a health risk .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Perhaps it 's because she was born after Three Mile Island ( and was n't old enough to watch the news during Chernobyl ) , but the Lantern does n't find herself particularly freaked out by atomic energy .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY A similar accident happened in Japan in 2011 after a tsunami hit the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The Cleaning power of Ionizing radiation will even help remove DNA damaged by the “ free ” radicals that may have caused the genetic damage in the first place and still be in place in the DNA molecule .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Of course , accidents are not the only measure of safety , and the absence of accidents does not necessarily indicate that there are no safety problems .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY There is also the potential for a nuclear reactor disaster , such as the explosion and meltdown that occurred at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986 or the partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979 .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The government 's Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a set safety goal for every reactor in the country : The chance of an accident that results in radioactivity being released to the environment must be no more than one in a million , as determined by probabilistic risk assessment .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The Chernobyl plant lacked a fundamental safety structure found in western plants , a steel-reinforced concrete shell that completely encapsulates the nuclear reactor vessel .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY If a meltdown were to occur in either the reactor or the spent fuel pool , the accident could kill and injure tens of thousands of people , cost billions of dollars in damages and leave large regions uninhabitable .

__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Three Mile Island , Chernobyl and Fukushima top the list of its negatives .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Reeling from a 9.0 earthquake and a devastating tsunami , Japan is now several weeks into the nuclear crisis at Fukushima , and desperate measures are all that ’s left .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY To others , it is an accident waiting to happen , a terrorism risk , a reckless use of technology than can permanently scar our planet , leaving vast swathes uninhabitable for thousands of years .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY However , serious safety problems continue to arise because the NRC does not adequately enforce those standards .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Open the castors and die of radiation ?
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Of course it is possible that each system in this series of back-ups might fail one after the other , but the probability for that is exceedingly small .

__label__ENERGY_POLICY Neither the language nor the history of NEPA suggests that it was intended to give citizens a general opportunity to air their policy objections to proposed federal actions .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY This could result in a level of destruction hitherto unenvisaged .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Imagine a world where the precautionary principle rules because any NPP accident is seen as disastrous ( millions die – even when they do n’t ) .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Because of their advanced design and sophisticated containment structures , U.S. nuclear plants emit a negligible amount of radiation . . . You would have to live near a nuclear power plant for over 2,000 years to get the same amount of radiation exposure that you get from a single diagnostic medical x-ray .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY On a day when one plant ( TMI-1 ) was shut down for refueling , the other plant ( TMI-2 ) suffered a serious accident that damaged the reactor and caused widespread concern .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT That element of risk lengthens the causal chain beyond NEPA 's reach .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The radiation from a reactor is tiny : about as much as that from our own bodies .
__label__OTHER Community institutions have already been weakened as a result of a loss of citizen confidence in the ability of these institutions to function properly and in a helpful manner during a crisis .

__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY We know what the errors in the construction of Chernobyl and the 1950s design in Fukushima are .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Even with all the safety checks in the world , people make errors and the slightest error could be very costly indeed .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Claims that nuclear energy is “ safe ” have no more grounding than the land the decimated Fukushima power plant sits upon .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS One of Caldicott ’s more outrageous contentions – that she calls into play as a fallback position and that belies her claim to being “ knowledgeable , ” or to being “ truthful and honest ” – is that human-made radiation is qualitatively different from natural background radiation .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Of course , the high-profile 1986 Chernobyl accident — the poster child for catastrophic nuclear meltdown — together with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ( a consequence of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ) have done little to increase public confidence in nuclear power .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY We all remember the Chernobyl accident , where the harmful effects of nuclear radiation on humans can even be witnessed today .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS If a nuclear factory broke down lots of people will die because some people are exposed to it .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In the light of the twin towers atrocity this is a completely unacceptable risk .
__label__COSTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY And costs are only so high , because safety standards have been forced to absurd levels by greens .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Operation of [ TMI-1 ] would be a constant reminder of the terror which they felt during the accident , and of the possibility that it will happen again .
__label__WEAPONS If these weapons go into the wrong hands , that could be the end of this world .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS PANE contended that restarting TMI-1 would cause both severe psychological health damage to persons living in the vicinity , and serious damage to the stability , cohesiveness , and well-being of the neighboring communities .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Lower radiation levels can cause cell damage that will eventually lead to cancer , which may not appear for years or even decades .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT A nuclear station broke down and massive amounts of radiation leaked out , killing many people over time and making some areas uninhabitable .

__label__OTHER The allied concept of “ carpet bombing ” civilian population centers ( two days of incendiary carpet bombing by U.S. pilots killed more than 100,000 residents of Tokyo during the war ) had now advanced to the next level : total annihilation .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY We do not understand how the accident at TMI-2 transforms PANE 's contentions into " environmental effects . "
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The plaintiffs in these cases could have alleged [ 460 U.S. 766 , 777 ] that the risk of crime ( or their dislike of the occupants of the facility ) would cause severe psychological health damage .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY While the casualties were not as high as with the Chernobyl accident , the environmental effects were disasterous .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Such a terrorist act would have catastrophic effects for the whole world .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY According to Tetsuo Iguchi , a professor in the department of quantum engineering at Nagoya University , if further complications arise and the situation deteriorates further , “ The worst-case scenario is that a meltdown makes the plant ’s site a permanent grave . ”
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT If a containment field were to rupture suddenly , the resulting leak of radiation could be catastrophic .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Disasters • One of the biggest disadvantages of nuclear energy is the occurrence of accidents due to core meltdown .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Factoring in the entire dose of natural background radiation accumulated over a lifetime , the risk of developing cancer as a result of this exposure is estimated to be roughly 1 in 100 .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY With the nuclear industry ’s litany of smaller radioactive leaks , accidents , opaque safety plans , and a history of cover-ups , people have every right to be very alarmed at the potential for a devastating nuclear accident coming to a plant near them .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__HEALTH_EFFECTS The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the NRC improperly failed to consider whether the risk of an accident at TMI-1 might cause harm to the psychological health and community well-being of residents of the surrounding area .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS If you lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant , you would receive an average radiation dose of about 0.01 millirem per year .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY In 2 out of 3 melt-downs there would be no deaths , in 1 out of 5 there would be over 1,000 deaths , and in 1 out of 100,000 there would be 50,000 deaths .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY After the accident at Three Mile Island , building of nuclear power generation stopped .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY While none of the safety problems harmed plant employees or the public , they occurred with alarming frequency — more than once a month — which is high for a mature industry .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY According to local doctors the region has seen a huge increase in childhood cancer cases since the Chernobyl disaster .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY An egregious example is the often repeated — by Caldicott , Gundersen and Hunziker — number of 1 million deaths as a direct result of Chernobyl .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Aided by a corrupt IAEA , the world has been subjected to a massive cover-up and deception about the true damages caused by Chernobyl . ”
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY There were no deaths or serious radiation doses from the Fukushima accident .
__label__OTHER In that case the reactor time constants are long and so the reactor is relatively easy to control .

__label__ENERGY_POLICY There is no evidence of an imminent threat to bulk reliability to justify interim subsidies .
__label__OTHER The % of Pa that would absorb extra neutrons in the blanket salt is low enough to ignore .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY And even if a jumbo jet did crash into a reactor and breach the containment , the reactor would not explode .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY While no technology can be perfectly safe , nuclear power is an inherently risky technology , and minimizing its risks requires stringent safety standards and practices .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Power reactors are well equipped to survive an impact of that kind without any significant radiological hazard locally .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS There is no evidence of any harm below about 100 mSv/yr .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Uranium mining is highly regulated in most countries and standards ensure that no adverse health effects are likely .
__label__WASTE The industry has shown that it can safely handle , transport and store the radioactive wastes generated by nuclear power .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Any car bomb would n’t work , as the several meters of concrete separating the reactor core from the outside world would protect it from such an explosion .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS And although the reactor itself was crippled , there was no injury or death among nuclear workers or nearby residents .
__label__OTHER Any water release is of surface run-off and is close to drinking standard .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Both of these plants were licensed by the NRC after extensive proceedings , which included preparation of Environmental Impact Statements ( EIS 's ) .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Periodic inspections also ensure that each facility operates safely .
__label__WASTE The nuclear waste buried in pits at the production sites is no threat to Gaia and dangerous only to those foolish enough to expose themselves to its radiation . "
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY A sever accident with a salt cooled reactor would provide a perfect water born path to spread contamination from the long half life products .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY ... No accidents of any kind have ever marred these dockings , no leaks have cleared blocks of cities ; no emergencies have been declared . "
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Utilities operating nuclear power plants must prove to the NRC that each plant can meet these stringent safety standards .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Water discharged from a nuclear power plant contains no harmful pollutants and meets regulatory standards for temperature designed to protect aquatic life .
__label__OTHER Any reactor licensable in the West has a substantial containment structure and most also have a very robust pressure vessel and internal structures .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY As he says , the modern nuclear plants as approved for Georgia are passively safe , requiring no operator intervention to shut down in an emergency .
__label__OTHER France and Germany have been using Nuclear power for years and they have n't had any problems .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY They are not shut-down because they have no safety problems to date .
__label__OTHER Nuclear power fitted neatly into the existing electricity generation and distribution system .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Efforts to ensure that nuclear power plants maintain this safety record are constantly emphasized , and the record compares favorably with all other ways of making electricity . ”
__label__COSTS Once built , the cost to operate a nuclear power plant is constant and predictable since the uranium fuel cost amounts to less than $ 0.0003 per KWH .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The “ chain reaction ” that is necessary to get the fission process going has to be relentlessly monitored to keep it within tolerable limits .

__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Hundreds of systems monitor , control , and support the safe operation of the reactor at each power plant .
__label__OTHER All nuclear reactors , at least in the West , are insured .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Nuclear plants also are safe for workers .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY These plants are designed , licensed , constructed , and operated to rigorous requirements established by the NRC .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY When these safety systems are properly installed and maintained , they function adequately .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Hence the need to keep the core cooled at all times , for control rods to drop into place at a moment ’s notice , to avoid radioactive leaks , for multiple back-up systems and fail-safe devices , at least two containment vessels , an evacuation plan , regular testing of workers and the surroundings , and so on .
__label__RELIABILITY __label__RENEWABLES Nuclear proponents also argue that nuclear energy production is constant , unlike fickle winds and sunshine .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The U.S. Navy has been safely operating nuclear reactors on ships for over 50 years .
__label__RELIABILITY A nuclear power plant when in the mode of producing energy can run uninterrupted for even a year .

__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Studies by the National Cancer Institute , The United Nations Scientific Committee of the Effects of Atomic Radiation , the National Research Council ’s BEIR VII study group and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements all show that U.S. nuclear power plants effectively protect the public ’s health and safety .
__label__WASTE Nuclear power is the only energy-producing industry which takes full responsibility for managing all its wastes , and bears the cost of this .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY There are now many hundreds of reactor years of experience , and Chernobyl was the only accident that injured the public .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Safety is a major consideration throughout the design , construction , and operation of a nuclear power plant .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS Studies by numerous health entities , including the National Cancer Institute and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation , show that US nuclear power plants effectively protect the public 's health and safety .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS True , but the level of radioactivity is very low & with normal engineering , they pose no threat to anyone .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The nuclear industry has an excellent safety record , with some 14,800 reactor years of operation spanning five decades .
__label__RELIABILITY Its supply is endless , unlike that of nuclear energy .
__label__TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION FS-MSRs operate with very low excess reactivity .
__label__HEALTH_EFFECTS During this time , no one in the U.S. has died or been injured as a result of operations at a commercial nuclear power plant .
__label__RENEWABLES __label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY __label__FOSSIL_FUELS Nuclear turns out to be five times safer than oil , ten times safer than gas and 100 times safer than hydro-electric dams .
__label__OTHER The reactor operates as a sealed system with an integrated salt processing system that is technically difficult to modify once contaminated .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY This tech is already proven to be safe and controllable , well beyond that of other nuclear .
__label__WEAPONS All traded uranium is sold for electricity production only , and two layers of international safeguards arrangements confirm this .
__label__OTHER GE is not about to give up on it ’s monopoly for building zirconium clad solid fuel rods that it can sell at almost any price because only they can be used in GE reactors .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT If , on the other hand , existing power structures were challenged , and the closing of Roxby were carried out in conjunction with the closing of all uranium mines and a disbanding of uranium interests , then the safety of these ecosystems would be assured .
__label__COSTS Because the existing plants will be amortised at the end of their originally planned life time , huge financial profits can be realised for any day longer which these plants can be kept in operation .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Since the areas around nuclear power plants are so clean , they are often developed as wetlands that allow trees , flowers , and grasses to thrive and provide nesting areas for waterfowl and other birds .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Wildlife has been flourishing there ( partly in the absence of humans , but clearly not harmed by the fallout ) , as described in Mary Mycio ’s book Wormwood Forest : A Natural History of Chernobyl .
__label__COSTS And a 10 billion dollar per plant construction boondoggle was great while it lasted — - .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY Nuclear plants in California are only built to withstand earthquakes of only 7 – 7.5 .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT For example the closing of Roxby mine would prevent the destruction of the surrounding ecosystem including mound springs inhabited by forms of aquatic life found nowhere else in the world .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT It can also cause damage to living things in and around the plants .
__label__OTHER It was simply unthinkable that a mineral which could be profitably sold would be left in the ground .

__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Many energy companies have created special nature parks or wildlife sanctuaries on plant sites .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The Diablo Canyon plant , located 200 miles northwest of Los Angeles near Santa Barbara , was built in 1968 near two fault lines , one three miles off the coast that suffered a 7.1 earthquake in 1926 .
__label__OTHER These measures have included pumping thousands of tons of seawater into the crippled reactors and spent fuel rod containment pools , dropping water from helicopters , and trying to plug a containment leak first with concrete , then a polymer , and finally with sawdust and rags .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT 8 The direct effects on the environment of this action include release of low-level radiation , increased fog in the Harrisburg area ( caused by operation of the plant 's cooling towers ) , and the release of warm water into the Susquehanna River .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Murray E. Jennex , an associate professor at San Diego State University with 20 years of experience in examining nuclear containment structures , believes that because these ad hoc measures are untested , they could be leading to greater problems , as spraying water everywhere wrecks delicate electrical equipment ; “ They dumped water all over the place … They keep on generating more contamination .
__label__ACCIDENTS/SECURITY The immense pressure of the water on an already compromised containment structure subject to continuing aftershocks could be enough to crack it open .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear power plants use much more water than alternatives .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The direct effects of this action include release of low-level radiation , increased fog , and the release of warm water into the Susquehanna River , all of which effects the NRC has considered .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Such demands on water resources are impractical , harm agriculture , and general raise water utility prices .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT The immense heat given off by this water can also be damaging to eco systems located nearby the reactor .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Presently 45 % of the freshwater usage in USA is for thermal power plants , which is completely unsustainable .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear energy requires substantial water to cool the reactor Nuclear power plants are only 35 % thermally efficient .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Nuclear plants require significant quantities of water to remove the waste heat - usually into the environment .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT You can not prevent CO2 emission altogether and as long as a MSR run as a standard thermal power plant you can not prevent the release of methane , water vapor and CO2 from cooling water .
__label__ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT Cooling those operations often requires a whole lot of water , the drawing and releasing of which can affect aquatic wildlife .
